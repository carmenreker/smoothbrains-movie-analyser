1
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,820
OK... Here we go. Focus.

2
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,260
Speed. I am speed.

3
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,700
One winner, 42 losers.

4
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,330
I eat losers for breakfast.

5
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,880
Breakfast.

6
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,040
Wait, maybe I should have had breakfast.

7
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,810
A little breck-y could be good for me. No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

8
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,750
I'm faster than fast. Quicker than quick.

9
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,410
I am lightning!

10
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,850
Hey, Lightning! You ready?

11
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,660
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

12
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,030
Ka-chow!

13
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,210
Get your antenna balls here!

14
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,950
Go, Lightnin'!

15
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,020
- Whoo! - You got that right, slick.

16
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,540
Uh!

17
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,860
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.

18
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,560
I'm Bob Cutlass, here with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

19
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,620
We're midway through what may be an historic day for racing.

20
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,730
Bob, my oil pressure's through the roof.

21
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,400
If this gets more exciting, they're gonna have to tow me outta the booth!

22
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,530
Right, Darrell.

23
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,240
Three cars are tied for the season points lead,

24
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,400
heading into the final race of the season.

25
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,250
And the winner of this race will win the season title and the Piston Cup.

26
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,010
Does The King, Strip Weathers,

27
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,490
have one more victory in him before retirement?

28
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,150
He's been Dinoco's golden boy for years!

29
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,420
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?

30
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,860
And, as always, in the second place spot we find Chick Hicks.

31
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,450
He's been chasing that tailfin his entire career.

32
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,690
Chick thought this was his year.

33
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,530
His chance to finally emerge from The King's shadow.

34
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,660
But the last thing he expected was... Lightning McQueen!

35
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,370
You know, I don't think anybody expected this.

36
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,070
The rookie sensation came into the season unknown.

37
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,640
But everyone knows him now.

38
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,780
Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?

39
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,450
The legend, the runner-up, and the rookie!

40
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,390
Three cars, one champion!

41
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,060
No you don't.

42
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,770
- Hey!

43
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,650
What a ride!

44
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,250
Go get 'em, McQueen! Go get 'em!

45
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,890
I love you, Lightning!

46
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,620
-Dinoco is all mine.

47
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,630
Trouble, turn three!

48
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,930
- Get through that, McQueen. -  Huge crash behind the leaders!

49
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,690
Wait a second, Darrell. McQueen is in the wreckage.

50
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,590
There's no way the rookie can make it through!

51
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,890
Not in one piece, that is.

52
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,210
Yeah!

53
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,250
Lightning! Oh!

54
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,620
Look at that! McQueen made it through!

55
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,160
A spectacular move by Lightning McQueen!

56
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,350
Yeah! Ka-chow!

57
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,690
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

58
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,730
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow!

59
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,030
While everyone heads into the pits,

60
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,860
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

61
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,930
Don't take me out, coach. I can still race!

62
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,150
What do you think? A thing of beauty.

63
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,150
- McQueen made it! - What?

64
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,270
He's not pitting!

65
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,480
You gotta get me out there! Let's go! Get me back out there!

66
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,320
McQueen's not going into the pits!

67
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,950
The rookie fired his crew chief. The third this season!

68
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,320
-  Says he likes working alone. - Go, go!

69
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,620
Looks like Chick got caught up in the pits.

70
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,100
Yeah, after a stop like that, he's got a lot of ground to make up.

71
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,570
Get ready, boys, we're coming to the restart!

72
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,550
Come on, come on, come on!

73
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,020
We need tires now! Come on, let's go!

74
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,800
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas! -What?

75
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,990
You need tires, you idiot!

76
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,310
Looks like it's gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

77
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,810
Right. No tires again.

78
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,570
That's a short-term gain, long-term loss,

79
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,310
but it's workin' for him. He obviously knows somethin' we don't know.

80
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,660
This is it, Darrell. One lap to go and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

81
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,590
He's got it in the bag. Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

82
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,960
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

83
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,670
- Checkered flag, here I come!

84
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,730
No! McQueen's blown a tire!

85
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,540
And with only one turn to go! Can he make it?

86
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,170
- You fool!

87
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,020
McQueen's blown a tire! He's blown a tire!

88
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,580
Go, go, go!

89
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,490
He's lost another tire!

90
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,800
- King and Chick come up fast! -  They're entering turn three!

91
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,730
Come on.

92
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,840
I don't believe what I'm watching, Bob!

93
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,440
Lightning McQueen is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

94
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,780
The King and Chick rounding turn four.

95
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,920
Down the stretch they come! And it's, and it's...

96
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,790
- It's too close to call! Too close! - I don't believe it!

97
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,230
Lightning!

98
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,520
- The most spectacular, amazing... - I don't believe it!

99
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,060
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending in the history of the world!

100
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,160
- And we don't know who won! - Look at that!

101
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,880
- That's very close to call. - Can we play that again?

102
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,150
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

103
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,290
We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the results.

104
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,760
We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the results.

105
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,290
McQueen, that was a risky move, not taking tires.

106
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,350
Tell me about it!

107
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,090
Are you sorry you didn't have a crew chief out there?

108
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,600
Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing than just winning.

109
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,570
I mean, taking the race by a full lap... Where's the entertainment in that?

110
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,570
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.

111
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,770
- Sizzle? - Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?

112
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,000
No, I'm not. 'Cause I'm a one-man show.

113
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,510
What? Oh, yeah, right.

114
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,640
That was a confident Lightning McQueen.

115
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,340
Live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz.

116
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,110
- Get outta the shot. - Yo, Chuck.

117
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,880
Chuck, what are you doing? You're blockin' the camera!

118
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,950
- Everyone wants to see the bolt. - What?

119
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,620
- Now, back away. - That's it! Come on, guys.

120
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,750
- Whoa, team! Where are you going? - We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

121
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,530
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

122
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,370
How will I ever find anyone else who knows how to fill me up with gas?

123
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,410
- Adios, Chuck! - And my name is not Chuck!

124
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,140
Oh, whatever.

125
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,230
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

126
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,610
Seriously, that was some pretty darn nice racin' out there.

127
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,910
- By me! - Oh, yeah.

128
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,510
- Zinger! - Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

129
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,250
The Piston Cup... It's mine, dude. It's mine.

130
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,880
Hey, fellas, how do you think I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

131
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,790
In your dreams, Thunder.

132
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,960
Yeah, right. Thunder? What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

133
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,870
You know, 'cause thunder always comes after lightning.

134
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,730
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

135
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,240
- Who knew about the thunder thing? - I didn't.

136
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,000
- Give us the bolt! - That's right.

137
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,540
Right in the lens.

138
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,870
- Show me the bolt, baby! - Smile, McQueen!

139
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,240
- Show me the bolt, McQueen! - That's it!

140
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,010
That was one close finish. You sure made Dinoco proud.

141
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,080
Thank you, King.

142
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,920
Well, Tex, you've been good to me all these years.

143
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,360
It's the least I could do.

144
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,660
Whatever happens, you're a winner to me, you old daddy rabbit.

145
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,530
Thanks, dear. Wouldn't be nothing without you.

146
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,300
Kch-i-ka-chow!

147
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,030
- I'm Mia. - I'm Tia.

148
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,370
We're, like, your biggest fans! Ka-chow!

149
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,940
I love being me.

150
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,110
OK, girls, that's it. - We love you, Lightning!

151
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,920
Hey, buddy. You're one gutsy racer.

152
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,550
Oh, hey, Mr. The King.

153
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,420
You got more talent in one lug nut

154
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,050
than a lot of cars has got in their whole body.

155
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,720
- Really? Oh, that... - But you're stupid.

156
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,360
- Excuse me? - This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

157
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,530
You need to wise up and get a good crew chief and a good team.

158
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,630
You ain't gonna win unless you got good folks behind you,

159
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,000
and you let them do their job, like they should.

160
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,810
- Like I tell the boys at the shop... - A good team.

161
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,780
Yeah...

162
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,080
Ka-chow! Ka-pow!

163
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,870
Oh, Lightning!

164
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,150
If you figure that out you just gonna be OK.

165
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,840
Oh, yeah, that... That is spectacular advice.

166
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,350
Thank you, Mr. The King.

167
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,510
Ladies and gentlemen,

168
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,820
for the first time in Piston Cup history...

169
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,590
A rookie has won the Piston Cup.

170
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,050
Yes!

171
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,070
... we have a three-way tie.

172
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,770
Hey, that must be really embarrassing.

173
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,510
But I wouldn't worry about it. Because I didn't do it!

174
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,980
Piston Cup officials have determined that a tiebreaker race

175
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,280
between the three leaders will be held in California in one week.

176
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,790
Well, thank you! Thanks to all of you out there! Thank you!

177
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,560
Hey, first one to California gets Dinoco all to himself.

178
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,600
No, not me! No, you rock, and you know that!

179
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,100
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

180
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,300
Yep! All right! Got it!

181
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,830
"First one to California gets Dinoco all to himself."

182
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,540
Oh, we'll see who gets there first, Chick.

183
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,710
Huh?

184
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,120
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie. - I don't want to talk about it.

185
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,050
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up. What'd you do with my trailer?

186
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,320
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent. - What?

187
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,380
Gotta make your personal appearance.

188
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,020
No. No! No, no, no, no!

189
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,560
Yes, yes, yes! Lightning McQueen here.

190
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,260
And I use Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!

191
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,030
Nothing soothes a rusty bumper like Rust-eze.

192
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,870
Wow! Look at that shine!

193
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,670
Use Rust-eze and you too can look like me!

194
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,010
Ka-chow!

195
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,270
I met this car from Swampscott.

196
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,410
He was so rusty he didn't even cast a shadow.

197
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,360
- You could see his dirty undercarriage. -

198
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,660
I hate rusty cars. This is not good for my image.

199
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,130
They did give you your big break. Besides, it's in your contract.

200
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,100
Oh, will you stop, please? Just go get hooked up.

201
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,130
- Winter is a grand old time. - Of this there are no ifs or buts.

202
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,640
But remember, all that salt and grime...

203
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,680
Can rust your bolts and freeze your...

204
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,710
Hey, look! There he is!

205
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,750
Our almost champ!

206
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,480
Get your rear end in here.

207
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,580
Lightning McQueen, you are wicked fast!

208
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,810
- That race was a pisser! - You were booking!

209
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,950
- Give me a little room. - You're my hero!

210
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,850
Yes, I know.

211
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,480
"Fred." Fred, thank you.

212
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,150
He knows my name. He knows my name!

213
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,190
Looking good, Freddie!

214
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,730
Thanks to you, Lightning, we had a banner year!

215
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,330
We might clear enough to buy you some headlights.

216
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,430
You saying he doesn't have headlights?

217
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,840
That's what I'm telling ya. They're stickers!

218
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,900
Well, you know, racecars don't need headlights,

219
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,970
because the track is always lit.

220
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,240
Yeah, well, so is my brother, but he still needs headlights.

221
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,920
- Ladies and gentlemen, - Lightning McQueen!

222
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,830
Free Bird!

223
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,230
You know, the Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment team

224
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,160
ran a great race today.

225
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,900
And remember, with a little Rust-eze...

226
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,170
And an insane amount of luck,

227
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,770
...you too, can look like me. Ka-chow.

228
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,880
- Hey, kid. - We love ya.

229
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,420
And we're looking forward to another great year.

230
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,780
Just like this year!

231
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,660
Not on your life.

232
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,450
- Don't drive like my brother! - Yeah, don't drive like my brother!

233
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,520
California, here we come!

234
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,290
Dinoco, here we come!

235
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:23,040
Oh... oh... uh, I needed this. Hello?

236
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,710
Is this Lightning McQueen, the world's fastest racing machine?

237
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,910
Is this Harv, the world's greatest agent?

238
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,750
And it is such an honor to be your agent

239
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,850
that it almost hurts me to take ten percent of your winnings.

240
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:40,020
Merchandising. And ancillary rights in perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ!

241
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,590
I didn't see it, but I heard you were great.

242
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,790
Thanks, Harv.

243
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,530
Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.

244
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,300
I'll pass 'em on to your friends. Shoot me the names.

245
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,500
- You let Harv rock it for you, baby. - Right. Friends.

246
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,510
Yes, there's...

247
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,040
OK, I get it, Mr. Popular.

248
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,240
So many you can't even narrow it down. Hey, when you get to town,

249
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,480
you better make time for your best friend!

250
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,720
Break bread with your mishpocheh here!

251
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,850
That'd be great! We should totally...

252
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,690
OK, I gotta jump, kid. Let me know how it goes. I'm out.

253
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,020
What? A minivan?

254
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,800
Come on, you're in the slow lane.

255
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,200
This is Lightning McQueen you're hauling here.

256
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,800
Just stopping off for a quick breather, kid.

257
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,310
- Old Mack needs a rest. - Absolutely not.

258
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,110
We're driving all night till we get to California. We agreed to it.

259
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,380
All night? May I remind you federal DOT regs state...

260
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,510
Come on, I need to get there before Chick and hang with Dinoco.

261
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,680
All those sleeping trucks.

262
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,490
Hey, kid, I don't know if I can make it.

263
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,990
Oh, sure you can, Mack.

264
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,390
Look, it'll be easy. I'll stay up with you.

265
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,330
- All night? - All night long.

266
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,750
Uh!

267
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,350
Ah-choo!

268
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,450
- Hey, yo, D.J. - What up?

269
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,540
- We got ourselves a nodder. -

270
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,430
Pretty music.

271
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,900
Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man.

272
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,460
- Right back at ya! - Yeah!

273
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,630
- Oops! I missed. - You going on vacation?

274
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,390
- Oh, no, Snot Rod... - He's gonna blow!

275
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,290
Ah... Ah... Ah-choo!

276
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,660
Gesundheit!

277
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,830
One should never drive while drowsy.

278
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,340
Uh! Ah!

279
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,820
Mack!

280
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,060
Mack!

281
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,260
Mack!

282
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,170
Hey, Mack! Mack!

283
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,830
Mack!

284
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,440
Mack, wait for me!

285
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,250
Mack!

286
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,900
Mack! Mack!

287
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,550
Mack! Mack...

288
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,080
...wait up! Mack.

289
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,080
Mack! Mack!

290
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,350
What? You're not Mack.

291
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:39,190
Mack? I ain't no Mack! I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake!

292
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,190
Turn on your lights, you moron!

293
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,300
Mack... The Interstate!

294
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,850
Huh?

295
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,790
Not in my town, you don't.

296
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,890
Oh, no.

297
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,520
Oh, maybe he can help me!

298
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,860
He's shooting at me! Why is he shooting at me?

299
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,300
I haven't gone this fast in years.

300
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,200
I'm gonna blow a gasket or somethin'.

301
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,610
Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!

302
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,370
What in the blue blazes?

303
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,970
Crazy hot-rodder.

[Hank Williams: My Heart Would Know]

305
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,570
I'm telling you, man, every third blink is slower.

306
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,750
The sixties weren't good to you, were they?

307
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,360
What? That's not the Interstate!

308
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,300
Ah! Oh!

309
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:00,670
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

310
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,940


311
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,110
No, no, no, no, no, no!

312
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,600
Ow!

313
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,840
I'm not the only one seeing this, right?

314
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,980
- Incoming! - Whoa, man.

315
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,380
- No! - Hey!

316
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

317
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,950
My tires!

318
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,830
Fly away, Stanley. Be free!

319
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,950
Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.

320
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,120
We're live at the Los Angeles International Speedway

321
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,720
as the first competitor, Lightning McQueen,

322
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,090
is arriving at the track.

323
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,100
Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?

324
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,330
What's your strategy?

325
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:43,070
What? Did I forget to wipe my mud flaps?

326
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,970
McQueen's driver arrived in California, but McQueen was missing.

327
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,000
- McQueen was reported missing. ...to race an unprecedented...

328
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,640
Sponsor stated they have no idea where he is.

329
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,080
I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate to see anything bad happen to him.

330
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,360
I don't know what's harder to find, McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!

331
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,520
Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs!

332
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,560
They're all asking the same question: Where is McQueen?

333
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,700
Oh, boy.

334
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,830
Where am I?

335
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,500
- Mornin', sleepin' beauty! - Ah!

336
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,700
Boy, I was wonderin' when you was gonna wake up.

337
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,480
Take whatever you want! Just don't hurt me!

338
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,450
A parking boot? Why do I have a parking boot on?

339
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,480
- What's going on here? Please! -  You're funny.

340
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,620
I like you already. My name's Mater.

341
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,120
Mater?

342
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,130
Yeah, like "tuh-mater," but without the "tuh".

343
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,470
- What's your name? - You don't know my name?

344
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,530
Uh...

345
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,010
No, I know your name. Is your name Mater too?

346
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,100
What?

347
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,940
Look, I need to get to California as fast as possible. Where am I?

348
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,280
Where are you? Shoot!

349
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,910
You're in Radiator Springs.

350
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,390
The cutest little town in Carburetor County.

351
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,320
Oh, great. Just great!

352
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,920
Well, if you think that's great, you should see the rest of the town.

353
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,800
You know, I'd love to see the rest of the town!

354
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,830
So if you could just open the gate, take this boot off,

355
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,630
you and me, we go cruisin', check out the local scene...

356
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,940
- Dad-gum! - How'd that be, Tuhmater?

357
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,530
- Cool! - Mater!

358
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,480
What did I tell you about talkin' to the accused?

359
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,040
To not to.

360
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,550
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

361
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,710
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

362
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,650
"Later, Mater." That's funny!

363
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,910
Ah!

364
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,690
The Radiator Springs Traffic Court will come to order!

365
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,290
Hey, you scratched my paint! I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

366
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,770
You broke-a the road! You a very bad car!

367
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,860
- Fascist! - Commie!

368
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,630
Officer, talk to me, babe. How long is this gonna take?

369
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,470
I gotta get to California, pronto.

370
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,700
Where's your lawyer?

371
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,040
I don't know. Tahiti maybe. He's got a timeshare there.

372
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:07,240
When a defendant has no lawyer, the court will assign one to him. Hey!

373
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,310
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

374
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,020
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

375
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,860
All rise! The Honorable Doc Hudson presiding.

376
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,320
Show-off.

377
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,730
May Doc have mercy on your soul.

378
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,990
- - All right,

379
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,190
I wanna know who's responsible for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

380
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,170
I want his hood on a platter!

381
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,900
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots! No, check that.

382
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,740
I'm gonna put him in jail till the jail rots on top of him,

383
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,470
and then I'm gonna move him to a new jail and let that jail rot.

384
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,070
I'm...

385
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,990
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

386
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,420
I want him out of my courtroom. I want him out of our town!

387
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,150
- Case dismissed. - Yes!

388
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,490
Boy, I'm purty good at this lawyerin' stuff.

389
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,030
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

390
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,060
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be from my attorney's office.

391
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,600
Hey, thanks for comin', but we're all set.

392
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,100
- He's letting me go. - He's letting you go?

393
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,110
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

394
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:08,340
All you have to do now is stand there and let me look at you.

395
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,970
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase. Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

396
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,010
- What the...? Ow! Oh! - Ka-chow!

397
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,140
- Please! - I know. I get that reaction a lot.

398
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,810
I create feelings in others that they themselves don't understand.

399
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,550
- - Agh! Ow!

400
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,030
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

401
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,120
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

402
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,960
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

403
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,630
Do what you gotta do, baby. But listen. Be careful.

404
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,400
Folks around here are not firing on all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

405
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,470
Ka-ching!

406
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,630
Ah!

407
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,710
I'll keep that in mind.

408
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,280
- Hey there, Mater. - Howdy, Sally.

409
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,950
- Hi, folks! - Good morning!

410
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,670
You know her?

411
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,720
She's the town attorney and my fiancee.

412
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,780
What?

413
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,950
Nah, I'm just kiddin'. She just likes me for my body.

414
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:01,860
You look great. You do something different with your side view mirrors?

415
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,590
What do you want, Sally?

416
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,030
Come on, make this guy fix the road. The town needs this.

417
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,270
No. I know his type. Racecar.

418
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,400
That's the last thing this town needs.

419
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,970
OK, I didn't want to have to do this, Doc, but you leave me no choice.

420
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,980
Fellow citizens, you're all aware of our town's proud history.

421
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,480
Here she goes again.

422
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,250
Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel

423
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,950
strung on the necklace of Route 66, the mother road!

424
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,820
It is our job and our pleasure to take care of the travelers

425
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,890
- on our stretch of that road. - Travelers? What travelers?

426
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,130
Ignore him.

427
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,570
But how, I ask you, are we to care for those travelers

428
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,970
if there is no road for them to drive on?

429
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,840
- Luigi, what do you have at your store? - Tires.

430
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,400
And if no one can get to you?

431
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,810
I won't sell any... tires. I will lose everything!

432
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,710
- Flo, what do you have at your store? - I have gas.

433
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,180
- Lotsa gas! - OK boys, stay with me.

434
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,780
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one can come to your station to buy gas?

435
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,350
I'll go outta business and... we'll have to leave town.

436
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,560
What's gonna happen if Flo leaves town and closes her station?

437
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,190
- Without gas, we're done for! - What?

438
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,100
Don't you think the car responsible should fix our road?

439
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,400
The only guy strong enough to fix that road is Big Al!

440
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,700
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

441
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,800
Then why are you bringing him up, you lemon?

442
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,870
Oh, he can do it.

443
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,740
He's got the horsepower. So, what do you want him to do?

444
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,280
Fix the road!

445
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,910
- Because we are a town worth fixing! - Yeah!

446
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,520
Order in the court!

447
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:39,060
Seems like my mind has been changed for me.

448
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,120
- Yeah! - No!

449
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,530
Nice ruling.

450
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,760
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

451
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,700
That's OK, Stickers. You can take Bessie.

452
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,600
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

453
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,300
I'd give my left two lug nuts for somethin' like that.

454
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,040
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

455
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:04,210
This here is Bessie, finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

456
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,350
I'm hereby sentencing you to community service.

457
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,150
You're gonna fix the road under my supervision.

458
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,560
What? This place is crazy!

459
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,790
I know this may be a bad time right now,

460
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,860
but you owe me $32,000 in legal fees.

461
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,920
What?

462
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,560
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie, and you're gonna pull her nice.

463
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,230
You gotta be kidding me.

464
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,970
You start there where the road begins.

465
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,340
You finish down there where the road ends.

466
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,580
Holy shoot!

467
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa! How long is this gonna take?

468
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,150
Well, fella does it right, should take him about five days.

469
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,380
Five days?

470
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,390
But I should be in California schmoozing Dinoco right now!

471
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,430
Then if I were you, I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

472
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,990
- Hook him up, Mater. - Okay-dokey.

473
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,300
Freedom!

474
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,140
Maybe I should've hooked him up to Bessie...

475
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,220
...and then... then took the boot off.

476
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,090
Whoo-hoo!

477
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,820
Goodbye, Radiator Springs, and goodbye, Bessie!

478
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,770
California, here I come! Yeah!

479
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,130
Oh, feel that wind.

480
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,170
Yes!

481
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,370
No. No, no, no.

482
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,980
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

483
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,040
How can I be outta gas?

484
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,080
Boy, we ain't as dumb as you think we are.

485
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,490
But how did, how did... you...?

486
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,890
We siphoned your gas while you were passed out.

487
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,860
- Ka-chow. - Ow, ow, ow, ow.

488
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,670
- Gentlemen. - Sheriff.

489
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,830
Hey, Sheriff.

490
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,170
- Why here? - [Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.

491
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,730
- They were better before. - Stai sempre a parlare.

492
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,680
- Guido! - Red, can you move over?

493
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,580
I want to get a look at that sexy hot rod.

494
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,480
You know, I used to be a purty good whistler.

495
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,280
I can't do it now, of course, on account of sometimes

496
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,260
I get fluid built up in my engine block,

497
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,690
but Doc said he's gonna fix it. He can fix about anything.

498
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,990
That's why we made him the judge.

499
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,330
Boy, you shoulda heard me on Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.

500
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,770
Now, I'm not one to brag

501
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,140
but people come purty far to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

502
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,630
Oh!

503
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,540
- Aw, man, that's just great! - Hey, what's wrong?

504
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,410
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

505
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,740
Ah, that ain't nothin'. I'll clean it for ya.

506
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,510
No, no, no!

507
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,920
That won't be necessary.

508
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,290
Hey! Hey, big fella! Yeah, you in the red!

509
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,990
I could use a little hose down. Help me wash this off.

510
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,420
Where's he goin'?

511
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,940
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and he hates you for killin' his flowers.

512
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,530
I shouldn't put up with this.

513
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,470
I'm a precision instrument of speed and aerodynamics.

514
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,570
- You hurt your what? - I'm a very famous racecar!

515
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,040
You are a famous racecar? A real racecar?

516
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,740
Yes, I'm a real racecar. What do you think? Look at me.

517
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,810
I have followed racing my entire life. My whole life!

518
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,190
Then you know who I am. I'm Lightning McQueen.

519
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,350
- Lightning McQueen? - Yes! Yes!

520
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,420
I must scream it to the world!

521
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:36,730
My excitement from the top of someplace very high!

522
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,290
- Do you know many Ferraris? - No, no, no, no, no.

523
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:42,340
They race on the European circuit. I'm in the Piston Cup!

524
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,040
- What? - Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

525
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,470
Is that what I think it is?

526
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,310
Customers.

527
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,840
Customers! Customers, everyone! Customers!

528
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,290
- OK! - Customers?

529
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,190
Been a long time. Remember what we rehearsed.

530
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,820
Make sure your "Open, please come in" signs are out.

531
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,420
You all know what to do. All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

532
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,160
Van, I just don't see any on-ramp anywhere.

533
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,640
- Minny, I know exactly where we are. - Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

534
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,370
- Honey, please. - Hello.

535
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,410
Welcome to Radiator Springs, gateway to Ornament Valley.

536
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,740
Legendary for its service and hospitality.

537
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,840
How can we help you?

538
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,980
- We don't need anything, thank you. - Ask for directions to the Interstate.

539
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,280
There's no need to ask for directions. I know where we're going.

540
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,790
He did the same thing on our trip to Shakopee.

541
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,690
We were headed over there for the Crazy Days, and we...

542
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,820
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK? - What you really need

543
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,960
is the sweet taste of my homemade, organic fuel.

544
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,730
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

545
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,000
- Just trying to find the Interstate. - Good to see you, soldier!

546
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:55,410
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut for your government surplus needs.

547
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,810
- Honey, surplus! - We have too much surplus.

548
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,210
I do have a map over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

549
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,450
And if you stay, we offer a free Lincoln Continental breakfast.

550
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,250
- Honey, she's got a map. - I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

551
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,780
- Never need a map again, thank you. - How 'bout somethin' to drink?

552
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,800
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Cafe. Finest fuel on Route 66.

553
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,020
No we just topped off.

554
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,970
And if you need tires, stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

555
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,500
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

556
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,900
- We're trying to find the Interstate. - But you do need a paint job.

557
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:29,140
Ramone will paint you up right. Hey, anything you want!

558
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,510
- You know, like a flame job. - No thanks...

559
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,910
Maybe ghost flames!

560
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,540
You like old school pinstripin'? Von Dutch style?

561
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:39,520
Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

562
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,610
OK, no. We're gonna be going now, OK?

563
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,180
Ow!

564
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,460
A little somethin' to remember us by, OK?

565
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,790
- OK! - Come back soon, OK?

566
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:53,360
I mean, you know where we are! Tell your friends!

567
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,030
OK! Yes. You bet.

568
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,370
Thanks again, folks. Bye-bye now.

569
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,540
Psst! Psst! Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

570
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,770
- I know how to get to the Interstate! - Do ya?

571
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,510
- Minny, no. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

572
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,050
No, not really. But listen.

573
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,750
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar. I'm being held against my will.

574
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,350
I need you to call my team, so they can come rescue me

575
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,260
and get me to California in time for me to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

576
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,490
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

577
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,430
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you! You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

578
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,660
I'm in hillbilly hell! My IQ's dropping by the second!

579
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,830
I'm becoming one of them!

580
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,840
OK, don't worry. They know where we are now.

581
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,670
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

582
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,610
We'll be back for our Hank Williams marathon...

583
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,410
- That's good. ...after a Piston Cup update.

584
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,390
Still no sign of Lightning McQueen. Chick arrived in California

585
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,910
and today became the first car to spend practice time on the track.

586
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,160
It's nice to get out here before the other competitors.

587
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:58,000
You know, get a head start. Gives me an edge.

588
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,230
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

589
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,300
Ha-ha!

590
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,140
Yeah!

591
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,090
Hey, McQueen... Eat your heart out.

592
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,390
Oh!

593
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,830
Let me get this straight.

594
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,840
I can go when this road is done. That's the deal, right?

595
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,630
- That's what they done did said. - OK. Outta my way.

596
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,800
I got a road to finish.

597
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:54,050
- He's done! - Done?

598
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,490
- Uh-huh. - It's only been an hour.

599
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,760
Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

600
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,700
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way. That's all you gotta say.

601
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,960
Whee-hoo! I'm the first one on the new road!

602
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,130
Oh!

603
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,170
It rides purty smooth.

604
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,870
- It looks awful! - Well, it matches the rest of the town.

605
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,470
Oh!

606
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,840
Red.

607
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,790
Who do you think you are?

608
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,160
Look, Doc said when I finish, I could go. That was the deal.

609
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,660
The deal was you fix the road, not make it worse.

610
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,200
Now, scrape it off! Start over again.

611
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:41,900
Hey, look, grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

612
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,460
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

613
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:47,770
Is that right? Then why don't we just have a little race? Me and you.

614
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,640
- What? -  Me and you. That a joke?

615
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,080
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

616
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:56,850
If I win, you do the road my way.

617
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,440
Doc, what're you doin'?

618
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,650
I don't mean to be rude here,

619
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,450
but you probably go zero to sixty in, like, what? Three-point-five years?

620
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,050
Then I reckon you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

621
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:11,790
You know what, old-timer? That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

622
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,060
Gentlemen, this will be a one-lap race.

623
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,630
You will drive to Willy's Butte, go around Willy's Butte and come back.

624
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,640
There will be no bumpin', no cheatin', no spittin',

625
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,240
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

626
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:31,450
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin', no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

627
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,280
and no lollygaggin'.

628
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,910
Speed. I'm speed.

629
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:37,550
Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer.

630
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:43,590
My friend Guido, he dream to give a real racecar a pit stop.

631
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,190
- Peet stop! - Uh...

632
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,140
The race is only one lap, guys.

633
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,700
Uno lappo! Don't need any help.

634
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:55,610
- I work solo mio. - Fine. Race your way.

635
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,780
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo? - OK.

636
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,870
Gentlemen...

637
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,350
...start your engines!

638
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,490
- Hijole! Check that out! - Whoa.

639
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,660
Great idea, Doc. Now the road will never get done.

640
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,330
Luigi?

641
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,600
On your mark, get set...

642
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,900
Uno for the money, due for the show,

643
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:31,670
tre to get ready, and quattro to... I can't believe it. Go!

644
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,490
Huh?

645
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,650
Doc... the flag means go.

646
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,060
Remember the fl... Here we go. Go.

647
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,860
Doc, what are you doing, man?

648
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:54,490
Oh, dear. It would seem I'm off to a poor start.

649
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,700
Well, better late than never. Come on, Mater.

650
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,540
- Might need a little help. - Uh... OK.

651
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,680
You got your tow cable?

652
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,940
Well, yeah, I always got my tow cable. Why?

653
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:08,310
Oh, just in case.

654
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,050
Ow! Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

655
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:20,860
No, no, no, no, no!

656
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,400
- Oh, man! - Whoa.

657
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:26,430
- Ow! - Bad trip, man.

658
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:35,600
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

659
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,040
- I'm confused. -

660
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,210
You drive like you fix roads.

661
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,480
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

662
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,120
Ah!

663
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,830
I'm startin' to think he knowed you was gonna crash!

664
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,020
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

665
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,070
I can make a little turn on dirt.

666
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,570
You think?

667
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,100
No. And now I'm a day behind. I'm never gonna get outta here!

668
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,640
Hey, ese! You need a new paint job, man!

669
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,680
- No, thank you. - How 'bout some organic fuel?

670
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,110
- That freak juice? - Pass.

671
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:19,640
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty. Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

672
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,310
Nah, not me, Flo.

673
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,860
I'm on one of them there special diets.

674
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:28,520
I'm a precisional instrument of speed and aero-matics.

675
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,360
"You race like you fix roads."

676
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:36,200
I'll show him.  I will show him!

677
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:48,880
Oh, great! I hate it!

678
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:52,580
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it! -  Music. Sweet music.

679
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:56,350
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

680
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,150
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

681
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:02,250
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

682
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,600
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now! I'm talking to Bessie!

683
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:22,710
Wow.

684
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,750
Mornin', Sally!

685
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:30,020
Hey, look at this here fancy new road that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

686
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,120
Yes! Uh, amazing!

687
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:36,220
Whoa-ho! Yeah!

688
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,500
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't seen you that low in years.

689
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,130
I haven't seen a road like this in years.

690
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,330
- Well, then let's cruise, baby. - Low and slow.

691
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:49,600
E bellissima! It's beautiful!

692
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,410
Guido, look, it's-a like it was paved by angels.

693
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,650
Boy, I tell you what.

694
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,550
I bet even the roads on the moon ain't this smooth.

695
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,280
Doc, look at this!

696
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,290
Shoulda tossed him into the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

697
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,850
Well, he ain't finished yet. Still got a long way to go.

698
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:09,900
Guido, look at Luigi!

699
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,230
This is fantastico!

700
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,760
That looks like fun! Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

701
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,140
Hey, Luigi, this new road makes your place look like a dump.

702
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:23,510
That crazy old devil woman.

703
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,380
Oh!

704
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:29,280
She's right!

705
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:30,910
- Ah! - Guido!

706
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:34,750
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

707
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:39,820
Well, now... where the heck is he?

708
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,900
Sheriff! Is he makin' another run for it?

709
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:52,340
No, no. He ran outta asphalt in the middle of the night,

710
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:54,770
and asked me if he could come down here.

711
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,240
All he's tryin' to do is make that there turn.

712
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,150
No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

713
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:03,140
Perfect turns on every track I've ever raced on.

714
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,310
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself a quart of oil at Flo's.

715
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:10,790
I'll keep an eye on him.

716
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:14,760
Well, thanks, Doc. I've been feelin' a quart low.

717
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,610
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

718
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,410
Oh, great. What do you want? You here to gloat?

719
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,820
You don't have three-wheel brakes, so you got to pitch it hard,

720
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:41,380
break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle.

721
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,520
Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips.

722
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:47,690
So you're a judge, a doctor and a racing expert.

723
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,420
I'll put it simple.

724
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,660
If you're goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turnin' right.

725
00:49:54,740 --> 00:50:00,140
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense. Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

726
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,010
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

727
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,670
Because in Opposite World, maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

728
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,880
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

729
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,460
Turn right to go left.

730
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,720
Hmm...

731
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,860
Whoa!

732
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,670
Oh!

733
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,100
Ow! Oh, that...

734
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,040
Ow!

735
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,750
Turn right to go left. Guess what. I tried it.

736
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:46,910
You know what? This crazy thing happened... I went right!

737
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:50,390
You keep talkin' to yourself, people'll think you're crazy.

738
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,390
- Thanks for the tip. - What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

739
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:04,830
- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo! - Che cosa?

740
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:09,280
- It looks great! This is great! - Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.

741
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,800


742
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,870
Oh, Lord.

743
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,580
-  -  Mater!

744
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,810
I need you to watch the prisoner tonight.

745
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:21,180
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute. What if he tries to run again?

746
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,090
Just let him run outta gas and tow him on back.

747
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,630
- But keep an eye on him. - Yes, sir!

748
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,390
Oh...

749
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,130
While I'm stuck here paving this stinkin' road,

750
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,760
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

751
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,100
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who's touching me?

752
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,470
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

753
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,570
You make-a such a nice new road.

754
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,310
You come to my shop. Luigi take-a good care of you.

755
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,970
Even though you not a Ferrari.

756
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:51,140
You buy four tires, I give you a full-a size spare

757
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:55,090
- absolutely free! - Look, I get all my tires for free.

758
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,680
I like your style, eh?

759
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,320
You drive the hard bargain. OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

760
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,860
You buy one tire, I give you three for free!

761
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:07,590
Oh, would you look at that?

762
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:09,800
Ramone, Ramone!

763
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,960
Then Luigi make you a new new deal.

764
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,030
No, no, no, no. Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

765
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:18,740
- No, no, no, no. No. - This is it. My last offer.

766
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:23,510
You buy one tire, I give you seven-a snow tires for free!

767
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,450
Done. You interested, you call me. You know where I am.

768
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,020
Ah!

769
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:31,220
Stop! Let me...

770
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:35,460
Oh, Red, you missed a spot. See it right there?

771
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:37,560
- No! No! - On the hood right there.

772
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:40,970
Stop, stop! That's cold!

773
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,530
Help! Please! Stop!

774
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,970
Thanks, Red.

775
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:49,470
What was that for?

776
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,670
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone? - Huh?

777
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,240
If you do, you gotta be clean.

778
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,840
'Cause even in hillbilly hell we have standards.

779
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,650
What, I...? I don't get it.

780
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,310
I thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job.

781
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:03,620
So I thought I'd let you stay with me. I mean, not with me!

782
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:08,320
But there. Not with me there, but there in your own cozy cone.

783
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,260
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's... - Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

784
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:14,730
If you want to stay at the dirty impound, fine.

785
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,070
- I understand you criminal types. - No, no, no, no. That's OK.

786
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,340
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone. - It's newly refurbished.

787
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:24,870
Yeah, it's like a clever little twist.

788
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:29,080
The motel's made out of caution cones, which, of course, cars try to avoid.

789
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:32,520
But now we're gonna stay in them. That's funny.

790
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,250
Figure that all out on your own, did you?

791
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:39,690
Cone number one, if you want.

792
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,160
Oh...

793
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:48,030
Hey, do I spy a little pinstriping tattoo back there?

794
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,200
Oh...  That's just a... Oh!

795
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:57,110
Oh, you saw that? Yeah. Just gonna be going.

796
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,810
Gonna... Yeah.

797
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:07,150
-You know, I knew this girl Doreen.

798
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,710
Good-lookin' girl.

799
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:12,090
Looked just like a Jaguar, only she was a truck!

800
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,650
You know, I used to crash into her, just so I could spoke to her.

801
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,230
- What are you talking about? - I don't know.

802
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:23,430
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight, 'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

803
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,670
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road, and I have to get out of here.

804
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,300
Well, that's all right, Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

805
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,680
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

806
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,510
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

807
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:38,580
You know who you're talkin' to? This is Lightning McQueen.

808
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,990
I can handle anything.

809
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:45,890
- I'm not doin' this. - Come on. You'll love it!

810
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,690
Tractor-tippin's fun. - This is ridiculous.

811
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,200
All right, listen.

812
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:56,260
When I say go, we go. But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

813
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,170
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

814
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,140
Mater!

815
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:02,640
Wait, Mater!

816
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:05,780
OK, here's what you do.

817
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:09,250
You just sneak up in front of 'em, and then honk.

818
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,810
And they do the rest. Watch this.

819
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,690
Oh!

820
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,960
Oh... Oh! Oh...

821
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:36,000
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

822
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,880
I tell you what, buddy, it don't get much better than this.

823
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,540
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

824
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,110
Oh!

825
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:51,780
Oh! Oh...

826
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:58,820
I don't care who you are, that's funny right there.

827
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,660
Oh, your turn, bud.

828
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,140
Mater, I can't. I don't even have a horn.

829
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,430
- Baby. - I'm not a baby.

830
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:09,980
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK? All right. I'll do something.

831
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:30,460
Oh!

832
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:02,830
That's Frank.

833
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:25,080
Run!

834
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,150
Here he comes, look out!

835
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,780
Whoa!

836
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,760
Run! He's gonna get ya!

837
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,210
Oh! Customers!

838
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,920
Oh!

839
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,320
Ah, no, no, no.

840
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,120
Oof! Oh!

841
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,560
Tomorrow night we can go look for the ghostlight!

842
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:12,120
- I can't wait, Mater. - Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

843
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,500
Oh, boy, you gotta admit that was fun!

844
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,510
Oh, yeah... yeah.

845
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:21,670
Well, we better get you back to the impound lot.

846
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:24,940
You know, actually, Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

847
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,000
Oh...

848
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:31,350
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we? - Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

849
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:35,690
Besides, she can't stand me. And I don't like her, to be honest.

850
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,660
Yeah, you probably right. Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

851
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:42,460
Where, where?

852
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:45,130
- You're in love with Miss Sally. - No, I'm not.

853
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,360
Yes, you do. - No way.

854
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,630
- Way. - Come on, look...

855
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,140
- You're in love with Miss Sally! - Real mature.

856
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:52,830
- You're in love! - Real grown up.

857
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:54,770
- You love her. You love her. - Wait...

858
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,870
You love her! You love her. You love her.

859
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,470
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

860
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,540
- Will you stop that? - Stop what?

861
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,920
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out. You're gonna wreck.

862
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:08,890
Wreck? Shoot! I'm the world's best backwards driver!

863
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,090
You just watch this right here, lover boy. Wee-hee!

864
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,820
What are you doing? Watch out! Look out!

865
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,300
Mater? Mater!

866
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,970
Mater!

867
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,550
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

868
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,320
Oof!

869
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:42,790
Yee-hee!

870
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,120
He's nuts.

871
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,660
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

872
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:53,200
Just need to know where I've been.

873
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:56,400
Whoa, that was incredible! How'd you do that?

874
00:59:56,470 --> 01:00:00,470
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some, and I'll teach you if you want.

875
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:03,770
Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race.

876
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,370
What's so important about this race of yours, anyway?

877
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,620
It's not just a race. We're talking about the Piston Cup!

878
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:15,020
I've been dreaming about it my whole life!

879
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:18,120
I'll be the first rookie in history ever to win it.

880
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:21,760
And when I do, we're talkin' big new sponsor,

881
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,490
with private helicopters.

882
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:26,830
No more medicated bumper ointment. No more rusty old cars.

883
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:29,030
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

884
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,470
Well, I don't mean you, Mater. I mean other old cars. You know?

885
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:37,710
- Not like you. I like you. - It's OK, buddy.

886
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:42,750
Hey, you think maybe one day I can get a ride in one of them helicopters?

887
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:47,410
I mean, I've always wanted to ride in one of them fancy helicopters.

888
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:50,290
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure. - You mean it?

889
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,120
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

890
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,160
I knew it. I knowed I made a good choice!

891
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:58,060
In what?

892
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:00,900
My best friend.

893
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,070
See you tomorrow, buddy!

894
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:12,600
McQueen and Sally parked beneath a tree,

895
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:16,350
K- i-s-somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t!

896
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:29,060
Number one. Number one... Ah, number one!

897
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:32,560
- Ah, this is nice. - Hey, Stickers.

898
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,760
- I'm sorry. - You scared me. You gotta be careful.

899
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,970
I scared myself scaring you scaring me.

900
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,140
- I mean, I wasn't like scared scared. - No, of course not. No.

901
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:44,940
- I was more... - I overheard you talkin' to Mater.

902
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:47,740
When? Just now? What, what did, what did you hear?

903
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,810
Something about a helicopter ride.

904
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,050
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got a kick out of that, didn't he?

905
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,020
- Did you mean it? - What?

906
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:57,120
- That you'll get him a ride. - Who knows?

907
01:01:57,190 --> 01:02:00,220
First things first. I gotta get outta here and make the race.

908
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,290
Uh-huh.

909
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,560
You know... Mater trusts you.

910
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:09,300
Yeah, OK.

911
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:12,070
- Did you mean that? - What?

912
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:17,770
Was it just a "Yeah, OK", or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?

913
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:20,510
Look, I'm exhausted. It's kinda been a long day.

914
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:24,080
Yeah, OK. G'night.

915
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,680
Oh...

916
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,950
Hey, thank you.

917
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,920
What did you just say?

918
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:36,830
You know, thanks for lettin' me stay here.

919
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,770
It's nice to be out of the impound, and this is... It's great.

920
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,400
- Newly refurbished, right? - Yeah.

921
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:47,830
- G'night. - Good night.

922
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,540
Hmm.

923
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,950
[Jimi Hendrix: Star Spangled Banner]

924
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:12,050
Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?

925
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:15,960
Respect the classics, man. It's Hendrix!

926
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,470
Ah!

927
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:36,010
No!

928
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:45,490
- No!

929
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,300
I gotta get outta here!

930
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:50,700
Hey, have you seen the Sheriff? Oh! Oh, my gosh.

931
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:54,030
- Hey, what are you doin'? - Get a good peek, city boy?

932
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:57,600
I just need my daily gas ration from the Sheriff.

933
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,800
Wait for him at Flo's. Get outta here.

934
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,540
I've been trying to get outta here for three days!

935
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:05,110
Hope you enjoyed the show!

936
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,490
Whoa, Doc.

937
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:24,300
Time to clean out the garage, buddy, come on.

938
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:41,980
What?

939
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:45,890
He has a Piston Cup?

940
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,730
Oh, my gosh.

941
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,130
Three Piston Cups?

942
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:12,440
-  Sign says stay out.

943
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:15,880
You have three Piston Cups. How could you have...

944
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:19,050
I knew you couldn't drive. I didn't know you couldn't read.

945
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,150
- You're the Hudson Hornet! - Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!

946
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:24,750
Of course. I can't believe I didn't see it before.

947
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:26,560
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

948
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:30,290
You used to hold the record for most wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.

949
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:33,100
- You gotta show me your tricks. Please. - I tried that.

950
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:35,900
You won three times! Look at those trophies!

951
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:39,410
You look. All I see is a bunch of empty cups.

952
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:49,950
You know, some automotive yoga could really lower your RPM's, man.

953
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,820
Oh, take a car wash, hippie.

954
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:55,120
Yeah, look at my husband, y'all! Whoo! That's your color!

955
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:58,920
- Yellow, baby. - Mmm. You smokin' hot!

956
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,060
There he is.

957
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:03,120
Oh, my gosh! Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?

958
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:09,140
- Doc? Our Doc? - Not Doc Hudson.

959
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:11,800
No, no, no, no, it's true! He's a real racing legend.

960
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,140
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

961
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:17,510
Fabulous? I never seen Doc drive more than 20 miles an hour.

962
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,640
I mean, have you ever seen him race?

963
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,310
No, but I wish I could have. They say he was amazing!

964
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:27,260
- He won three Piston Cups! - He did what in his cup?

965
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:29,660
I think the heat's startin' to get to the boy!

966
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:31,860
Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.

967
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:34,330
I think he needs a new coat of poly, man.

968
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,160
-  Are you sick, buddy? - You are lookin' peaked.

969
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,000
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!

970
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:44,830
-  Hey! What are you doin'? - It's OK. You can trust me, right?

971
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:47,610
I trust you, all right. It's him I'm worried about.

972
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:50,880
Hmm... I trust him.

973
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:54,150
- Come on, let's take a drive. - A drive?

974
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,520
Yeah, a drive.

975
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:58,720
Don't you big city racecars ever just take a drive?

976
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:01,490
Ah... No. No, we don't.

977
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:27,820
Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?

978
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,820
Mm-hm!

979
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:38,350
- And you thought he was gonna run. - Hey, can you believe it, man?

980
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,860
He actually thought Doc was a famous racecar!

981
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,870
That's so too much!

982
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,370
OK, you got me out here. Where are we goin'?

983
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,430
I don't know.

984
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:57,300
Whoa! Yes.

985
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,760
Oh! Ah-ha-ha!

986
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:19,500
- Bleah! -

987
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,490
Oh!

988
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:49,490
Wow. What is this place?

989
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,560
Wheel Well.

990
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:54,890
Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.

991
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:01,270
This place?

992
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,940
Yeah, imagine.

993
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:11,340
Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here.

994
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:15,240
You know, I don't get you.

995
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,550
How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?

996
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:20,820
Well, it's really pretty simple. I was...

997
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:25,060
...an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and...

998
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:28,690
Oh, you were, were you? Were you rich?

999
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:32,170
- What? - Just... clues to the puzzle.

1000
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:35,570
Yeah, OK. Well, that was my life.

1001
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,400
And you know what?

1002
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:41,100
It never felt... happy.

1003
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:45,840
Yeah. I mean... really?

1004
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,650
Yeah. So I left California.

1005
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,020
Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here.

1006
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,550
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

1007
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:57,620
Well, they all did. And I never left.

1008
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,590
Yeah. You know, I understand.

1009
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:03,500
You need a little R and R. Recharge the old batteries.

1010
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:07,300
But you know, after a while, why didn't you go back?

1011
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:11,730
I fell in love.

1012
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:15,470
- Oh. - Yep.

1013
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:19,110
- Corvette? - No.

1014
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,420
I fell in love with this.

1015
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,170
Whoa. Look at that.

1016
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,370
Look, they're drivin' right by.

1017
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,640
They don't even know what they're missing!

1018
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:51,980
Well, it didn't used to be that way.

1019
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:54,780
Oh, yeah?

1020
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:58,760
Yeah. Forty years ago, that Interstate down there didn't exist.

1021
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:00,880
Really?

1022
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,660
Yeah. Back then,

1023
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:06,600
cars came across the country a whole different way.

1024
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:09,200
How do you mean?

1025
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:12,670
The road didn't cut through the land like that Interstate.

1026
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:16,940
It moved with the land, you know? It rose, it fell, it curved.

1027
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,430
- Mornin'! - Nice day, huh?

1028
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:25,150
Cars didn't drive on it to make great time.

1029
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:27,780
They drove on it to have a great time.

1030
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:04,190
Well, what happened?

1031
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,710
The town got bypassed just to save ten minutes of driving.

1032
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:37,470
How great would it have been to see this place in its heyday!

1033
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:40,350
Oh, I can't tell you how many times I've dreamed of that.

1034
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:44,080
But one of these days we'll find a way to get it back on the map.

1035
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:47,820
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

1036
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:49,720
I had a great time.

1037
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:52,520
It's kinda nice to slow down every once in a while.

1038
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,330
You're welcome.

1039
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:03,970
Hey, listen, listen!

1040
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,140
If anybody asks you, we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?

1041
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:09,300
Wha... what?

1042
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:26,690
Oh, man, the paint's still wet!

1043
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:39,170
No, no, no, no! Get out of the store!

1044
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,840
Hey! Don't eat the radial! Here, take-a the snow tires.

1045
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:45,210
-  Mater! - I wasn't tractor-tippin'!

1046
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,310
Then where did all these gol-durn tractors come from?

1047
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:50,890
- Whoa, boy! - Hey! Hey, guys!

1048
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,920
There's one goin' this way.

1049
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:56,090
I got it.

1050
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,900
Come here, little tractor, come here.

1051
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,230
Yeah, that's a good tractor.

1052
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,670
No, no, no, no, come here.

1053
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:07,100
What are you doing?

1054
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:09,870
You're not supposed to go wandering off all...

1055
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:12,540
...alone.

1056
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:27,150
What are you doin' with those old racin' tires?

1057
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:36,130
Come on, Doc, drive.

1058
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:55,810
Ah... Yeah.

1059
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,540
- Wow. - Huh?

1060
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:59,210
You're amazing!

1061
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:03,450
What are you doin'?

1062
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,220
Doc, wait!

1063
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:11,530
Giddup right in there! Come on, Rusty.

1064
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:17,630
Doc, hold it! Seriously, your driving's incredible!

1065
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:21,000
- Wonderful. Now, go away. - Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!

1066
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,900
- I'm askin' you to leave. - Come on.

1067
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:25,970
I'm a racecar, you're a much older racecar,

1068
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,030
but under the hood you and I are the same.

1069
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:31,170
We are not the same! Understand? Now, get out.

1070
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:34,180
How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?

1071
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:38,520
You think I quit?

1072
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,800
Right.

1073
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,070
Your big wreck in '54.

1074
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:59,110
They quit on me.

1075
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:02,740
When I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome.

1076
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:05,710
You know what they said? "You're history."

1077
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:08,840
Moved right on to the next rookie standing in line.

1078
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:13,920
There was a lot left in me.

1079
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:17,650
I never got a chance to show 'em.

1080
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:23,190
I keep that to remind me never to go back.

1081
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:27,530
I just never expected that that world would...

1082
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:29,800
...would find me here.

1083
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:33,500
- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them. - Oh, yeah?

1084
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:34,570
No, I'm not.

1085
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:38,480
When is the last time you cared about something except yourself, hot rod?

1086
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:43,150
You name me one time and I will take it all back.

1087
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:47,980
Uh-huh. I didn't think so.

1088
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:52,160
These are good folk around here, who care about one another.

1089
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,930
I don't want 'em depending on someone they can't count on.

1090
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,530
Oh, like you? You've been here how long

1091
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,830
and your friends don't even know who you are?

1092
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:03,560
Who's caring about only himself?

1093
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,440
Just finish that road and get outta here!

1094
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,510
[Jimi Hendrix: Star Spangled Banner]

1095
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:23,290
Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?

1096
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,800
Respect the classics, man.

1097
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:38,340
Ah...

1098
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,620
He's done.

1099
01:20:53,690 --> 01:20:56,920
He must've finished it while we was all sleepin'.

1100
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:59,220
Good riddance.

1101
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,540
He's gone?

1102
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:11,630
Well, we wouldn't want him to miss that race of his.

1103
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:21,420
- Oh, dude, are you crying? - No! I'm happy!

1104
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:24,450
I don't have to watch him every second of the day anymore!

1105
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:25,720
I'm glad he's gone!

1106
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:34,130
What's wrong with Red?

1107
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,600
Oh, he's just sad 'cause you left town

1108
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:40,600
and went to your big race to win the Piston Cup

1109
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:43,540
that you've always dreamed about your whole life

1110
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:49,140
and get that big ol' sponsor and that fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.

1111
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:56,080
Wait a minute!

1112
01:21:57,490 --> 01:22:00,320
I knowed you wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.

1113
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:03,120
What are you doin' here? You're gonna miss your race.

1114
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:06,860
Don't worry. I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up time.

1115
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:08,090
Thank you, Sheriff.

1116
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:10,290
But you know I can't go just yet.

1117
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:11,860
Well, why not?

1118
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:14,770
I'm not sure these tires...

1119
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,740
...can get me to California. - Peet stop?

1120
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:21,070
Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens?

1121
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:22,480
I can't-a believe it! Four new tires!

1122
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,310
I can't-a believe it! Four new tires!

1123
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,110
Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!

1124
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:31,280
- Would you look at that! - Our first customer in years!

1125
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,950
I am filled with tears of ecstasy,

1126
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:38,890
for this is the most glorious day of my life!

1127
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,960
All right, Luigi, give me the best set of blackwalls you've got.

1128
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:44,400
No! No, no, no.

1129
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:47,840
You don't-a know what you want. Luigi know what you want.

1130
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:53,340
Blackwall tires. They blend into the pavement.

1131
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:54,880
But-a this...

1132
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:57,010
Whitewall tires!

1133
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:02,250
They say, "Look at me! Here I am! Love me."

1134
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,120
All right, you're the expert.

1135
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:07,120
Don't forget the spare.

1136
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:10,020
- Perfetto. Guido! - Peet stop!

1137
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:24,340
What did Luigi tell you, eh?

1138
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:27,870
Wow, you were right. Better than a Ferrari, huh?

1139
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:29,810
Eh... No.

1140
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:37,280
Wow! This organic fuel is great! Why haven't I heard about it before?

1141
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:39,350
It's a conspiracy, man!

1142
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,890
The oil companies got a grip on the government!

1143
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:45,190
They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.

1144
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,390
OK, I'll take a case.

1145
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:03,910
Ow! Eh!

1146
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,380
Ah... Yeah.

1147
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:16,450
Ka-chow.

1148
01:24:17,330 --> 01:24:20,300
- Here she comes! - Places, everybody. Hurry!

1149
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,090
Act natural.

1150
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:23,500
- Hi, Sally. - Buon giorno!

1151
01:24:23,570 --> 01:24:25,400
All right, what's goin' on?

1152
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:27,630
Ladies and gentlecars,

1153
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:31,640
please welcome the new Lightning McQueen!

1154
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,270
Pow! What do you think?

1155
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:36,540
Radiator Springs looks pretty good on me.

1156
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:38,410
I'll say.

1157
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,680
Ka-chow.

1158
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:44,280
You're gonna fit right in in California.

1159
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:48,280
My goodness. It looks like you've helped everybody in town.

1160
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,190
Yeah, everybody except one.

1161
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:56,420
- Hey, is it getting dark out? - What? What'd he say?

1162
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:59,530
Let me say that again. Is it getting dark out?

1163
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,800
Now, what was I supposed to do after that?

1164
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,590
They fixed their neon!

1165
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:41,000
- Low and slow? - Oh, yeah, baby!

1166
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:48,650
Just like in its heyday, right?

1167
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:52,090
It's even better than I pictured it. Thank you.

1168
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:20,950
Shall we cruise?

1169
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:23,350
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1170
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,890
- No, no, no. - Lizzie!

1171
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:29,290
I remember when Stanley first asked me to take a drive with him.

1172
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,230
Hey, Miss Sally. May I have this cruise?

1173
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,660
- Of course, Mater. - Uh-uh-uh!

1174
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:46,510
...and again and I said, "No." He asked me again, and I said, "No."

1175
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:50,910
But, oh, he was a persistent little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1176
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:54,380
Finally I said, "All right, one little drive."

1177
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:59,550
Oh!

1178
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:06,020
- Hey! - Thanks, Mater.

1179
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:08,390
Good evenin', you two.

1180
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:16,130
Oh, Stanley, I wish you could see this.

1181
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:24,040
- Is that what I think it is? - Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1182
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:29,780
I haven't had a chance to find out. But I am going to find out. Hello.

1183
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:32,450
Not that. That.

1184
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:32,590
Customers?

1185
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:34,920
Customers?

1186
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:37,650
Customers, everybody! And a lot of 'em!

1187
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:39,890
You know what to do. Just like we rehearsed.

1188
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:43,630
It's the ghostlight!

1189
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:46,290
We have found McQueen. We have found McQueen!

1190
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:48,640
McQueen, over here!

1191
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:51,470
- Wait, excuse me. - Is it true you've been in rehab?

1192
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:53,670
- Did you have a nervous breakdown? - What?

1193
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:56,470
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls! - Your tires balding?

1194
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:57,540
Stickers!

1195
01:27:57,610 --> 01:27:59,780
- Was McQueen your prisoner? - Shoot, no!

1196
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:02,320
We're best buds! I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1197
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:05,580
but I was in charge of huntin' him down if he tried to escape.

1198
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:07,250
Sally! Sally!

1199
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,380
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1200
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,190
- Stickers? - Sally!

1201
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:13,660
Come on, give us some bolt!

1202
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:18,220
You're here! Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1203
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:21,670
- Mack? - You're here! I can't believe it!

1204
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:25,610
You are a sight for sore headlights!

1205
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,410
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss. I'll make it up to you!

1206
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,340
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1207
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:33,010
Is that the world's fastest racing machine?

1208
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:35,610
- Is that Harv? - Yeah. He's in the back.

1209
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:40,160
- Show us the bolt! - Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1210
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:43,490
- Where's the old McQueen? - Actually, this is my good side here.

1211
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:45,820
- Harv! Harv! - Give us the bolt!

1212
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:47,750
- Harv? - Come on!

1213
01:28:47,830 --> 01:28:50,530
- Kid, I'm over here! - How you doin', buddy?

1214
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,260
My star client disappears off the face of the earth!

1215
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,530
- How do you think I'm doing? - I can explain.

1216
01:28:55,610 --> 01:29:00,010
I'm doing great! You're everywhere! Radio, TV, the papers!

1217
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:03,140
You can't buy this kind of publicity! What do you need me for?

1218
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:05,680
That's just a figure of speech, by the way. You signed a contract.

1219
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:08,050
Where are you? I can't even find you on my GPS.

1220
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,640
I'm in this little town called Radiator Springs.

1221
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:13,920
- You know Route 66? It's still here! - Yeah, that's great, kid.

1222
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:15,190
Playtime is over, pal.

1223
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:19,090
While the world's been trying to find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.

1224
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:20,860
- Who are they gonna woo? - Chick!

1225
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:24,560
Bingo. In fact, check out what's on the plasma right now.

1226
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,800
- Show us the thunder! - You want thunder?

1227
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:30,500
You want thunder? Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!

1228
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:33,840
- Hey, that's my bit! - You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!

1229
01:29:33,850 --> 01:29:35,800
Just get out of Radiation Stinks now, 

1230
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,810
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?

1231
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,710
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1232
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,580
No, wait. Where are you goin'?

1233
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:44,920
Get in the trailer, baby. Kid! You want a bigger trailer?

1234
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:51,860
Sally, I... I want you to...

1235
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:55,590
Look, I wish...

1236
01:29:57,070 --> 01:29:59,930
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1237
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:07,300
- It was just a road. - No. It was much more than that.

1238
01:30:10,450 --> 01:30:13,640
Hey, kid! We gotta go. Harv's goin' crazy!

1239
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:16,950
He's gonna have me fired if I don't get you in the truck right now!

1240
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:19,750
- Mack, just... hold it for... - You should go.

1241
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:22,050
- I know, but... - Good luck in California.

1242
01:30:24,430 --> 01:30:27,450
I hope you find what you're looking for.

1243
01:30:27,530 --> 01:30:29,620
- McQueen, come on! - Sally...

1244
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,930
- Sally! - Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1245
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,100
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1246
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:43,710
- Come on, get in the trailer. - Where's the old McQueen?

1247
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:46,150
- The bolt! - That's it. That's right, let's go!

1248
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:48,910
You're a big shining star. You're a superstar.

1249
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:51,280
You don't belong there, anyway.

1250
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,350
Whoa... Wait... Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1251
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,390
Hey, guys! McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1252
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:08,900
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1253
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:11,370
- Yeah. - Thanks for the call.

1254
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:23,580
- You called them? - It's best for everyone, Sally.

1255
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:27,350
Best for everyone or best for you?

1256
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,640
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1257
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:49,540
Hello, race fans. Welcome to what has become, quite simply,

1258
01:32:49,610 --> 01:32:51,900
the biggest event in the history of racing.

1259
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:54,210
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1260
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:56,750
There's a crowd of nearly 200,000 cars

1261
01:32:56,810 --> 01:32:59,370
here at the Los Angeles International Speedway.

1262
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:03,780
Tickets to this race are hotter than a black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1263
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:06,410
The King, Chick Hicks and Lightning McQueen

1264
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:09,820
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all, tiebreaker race.

1265
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:13,120
I got a lotta miles on me, but let me tell you somethin'.

1266
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:17,190
I never thought I'd see anything like this. This is exciting!

1267
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:19,600
In fact, the country has almost shut down

1268
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:23,770
to watch what many experts are calling "the race of the century."

1269
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,470
Hey, King! Good luck in your last race.

1270
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:30,640
- You've sure been an inspiration to me. - Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1271
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:33,810
- Hey, be careful out there, OK? - Yeah, man.

1272
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:34,870
He's hot!

1273
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:37,610
Wanna know the forecast? I'll give you the forecast.

1274
01:33:37,690 --> 01:33:40,780
A 100 percent chance of thunder! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1275
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:43,380
Say it with me! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1276
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:46,400
Hey, you! No admittance without a garage pass.

1277
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:49,230
Oh, it's OK. Lightning McQueen knows me!

1278
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:52,430
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day for a race, isn't it?

1279
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:57,460
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti. - And good morning to you, Fred.

1280
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:01,440
Mario Andretti knows my name! You gotta let me in now!

1281
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:02,770
Sorry, pal.

1282
01:34:02,850 --> 01:34:07,110
OK, here we go. Focus. Speed.

1283
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:10,680
I am speed.

1284
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:13,620
Victory.

1285
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:15,820
One winner, two losers.

1286
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:23,460
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1287
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,230
Lightnin'! You ready?

1288
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:33,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1289
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:49,190
Mack, thanks for being my pit crew today.

1290
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:51,850
Don't worry about it, kid. It's the least I could do.

1291
01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:54,330
After all, "Gas Can" is my middle name.

1292
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,760
- It is? - Ah... Not really.

1293
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:15,450
Uh-oh

1294
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:29,300
Nelson! Zoom in. Ready, 16? Take 16.

1295
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:31,700
And there he is, Lightning McQueen!

1296
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:34,900
Missing all week, and then he turns up in the middle of nowhere!

1297
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:37,370
In a little town called Radiator Springs.

1298
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:40,500
Wearin' whitewall tires, of all things.

1299
01:35:41,650 --> 01:35:44,770
- Oh! - Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1300
01:35:44,850 --> 01:35:46,010


1301
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,410
Hey, where you been? I've been kinda lonely.

1302
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:51,390
Nobody to hang out with. I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1303
01:35:51,450 --> 01:35:54,450
And the twins. Of course. The ones that used to be your fans,

1304
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:57,690
but now they're my fans. Listen to what the twins think...

1305
01:36:04,530 --> 01:36:06,590
Agh! Shoot!

1306
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:09,800
Boogity, boogity, boogity, boys! Let's go racin'!

1307
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,640
Come on, you can do it!

1308
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:19,740
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1309
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:24,150
Fifty laps down, and The King is still holding a slim lead.

1310
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:27,450
McQueen's got a run on him! He's lookin' to the inside!

1311
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:31,790
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1312
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:34,260
Chick's not making it easy on him today.

1313
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,060
He lost momentum,

1314
01:36:36,130 --> 01:36:38,430
and now he's gonna have to chase him back down!

1315
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,900
McQueen spins out in the infield!

1316
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:56,480
Just me and the old man, fellas.

1317
01:36:56,550 --> 01:37:00,080
McQueen just doesn't have it today.

1318
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:05,320
- Hey, kid, are you all right? - I don't know, Mack.

1319
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:06,790
I don't think I...

1320
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:09,550
I didn't come all this way to see you quit.

1321
01:37:09,550 --> 01:37:11,100
Doc?

1322
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:16,430
Guys, you're here! I can't believe this!

1323
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:20,540
I knew you needed a crew chief, but I didn't know it was this bad.

1324
01:37:20,610 --> 01:37:22,510
You said you'd never come back.

1325
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:26,170
Well, I really didn't have a choice. Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1326
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:29,150
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1327
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:36,620
All right, if you can drive as good as you can fix a road

1328
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:39,960
then you can win this race with your eyes shut.

1329
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:42,020
Now, get back out there!

1330
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:47,240
Hot snot, we are back in business! Guido! Luigi!

1331
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:49,600
You're goin' up against professional pit crews.

1332
01:37:49,670 --> 01:37:52,840
- You're gonna have to be fast. - They will not know what bit them!

1333
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:54,600
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1334
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:58,080
Find a groove that works for you and get that lap back.

1335
01:38:09,790 --> 01:38:11,690
- Is it? - Oh, wow. That's him!

1336
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,530
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet! The Hudson Hornet's back!

1337
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,230
It appears McQueen has got himself a pit crew.

1338
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,700
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1339
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:23,470
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet! - Whoa!

1340
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:26,870
Well, dip me in axle grease and call me Slick! It surely is.

1341
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:33,540
Wow, this is history in the making.

1342
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:36,520
Nobody has seen the racing legend in over 50 years!

1343
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:37,990
Hey, Doc!

1344
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:42,220
Come look at this fellow on the radio. He looks just like you.

1345
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:50,930
-  McQueen passes on the inside! -  He's nearly a lap down.

1346
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,900
Can he catch up to them with only 60 laps to go?

1347
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:56,870
You're goin' great, kid. Just keep your head on.

1348
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:58,530
Vai! Vai, vai!

1349
01:38:58,610 --> 01:39:01,510
Hey, shrimpie, where did McQueen find you, huh?

1350
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:05,010
Those round things are called tires, and they go under the car!

1351
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:06,830
Con chi credi di parlare?

1352
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:07,780
- Ma, con chi stai parlando? -No!

1353
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:09,280
You'll have your chance.

1354
01:39:09,290 --> 01:39:11,660
You will have your chance.

1355
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:29,270
Oh, kid's just tryin' to be a hero, huh?

1356
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,100
What do you think of this?

1357
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:34,340
Yeah, that's it, kid.

1358
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:38,940
What?

1359
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:40,810
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1360
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:46,850
-  I taught him that. Ka-chow! - Ah!

1361
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:49,890
What a move by McQueen! He's caught up to the leaders.

1362
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,790
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1363
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:55,020
A three-way battle for the lead, with ten to go!

1364
01:39:58,670 --> 01:40:01,870
Look at that boy go out there!

1365
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:09,880
Oh!

1366
01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:12,370
No, you don't.

1367
01:40:15,450 --> 01:40:17,440
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1368
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,960
- Can you get back to the pits? - Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1369
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:24,320
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in. Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1370
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:28,390
We gotta get him back out there fast

1371
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:31,400
or we're gonna be a lap down, and we'll never win this race!

1372
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:33,630
Guido! It's time.

1373
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:41,000
Hey, tiny, you gonna clean his windshield?

1374
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:51,550
I don't believe it!

1375
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:53,320
That was the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1376
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:55,950
It was a great stop, but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1377
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:57,720
It's gonna be close.

1378
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,860
Yeah, baby!

1379
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,300
He's back in!

1380
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:05,620
Peet stop.

1381
01:41:07,070 --> 01:41:09,000
- Guido, you did it! - Way to go, Guido!

1382
01:41:24,290 --> 01:41:27,350
This is it. We're heading into the final lap and McQueen

1383
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:29,790
is right behind the leaders. What a comeback!

1384
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:33,390
A hundred and ninety-nine laps! It all comes down to this!

1385
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:34,730
This is it, kiddo.

1386
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,290
You've got four turns left. One at a time.

1387
01:41:37,370 --> 01:41:39,800
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1388
01:41:39,870 --> 01:41:41,270
Go!

1389
01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:45,100
We'll see about that!

1390
01:41:46,610 --> 01:41:48,170
McQueen's going inside!

1391
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:54,170
- Chick and King are loose! -  I think McQueen's out!

1392
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:07,330
- McQueen saved it! -  He's back on the track!

1393
01:42:07,730 --> 01:42:10,390
- Float like a Cadillac... - Sting like a Beemer!

1394
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:15,100
Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...

1395
01:42:16,670 --> 01:42:19,670
Lightning McQueen is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1396
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:21,840
Come on! You got it! You got it, Stickers!

1397
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:27,150
I am not comin' in behind you again, old man.

1398
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:39,390
Oh, no!

1399
01:42:57,910 --> 01:43:00,110
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1400
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:03,910
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1401
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:07,350
What's he up to, Doc?

1402
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:19,100
What are you doin', kid?

1403
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:22,400
I think The King should finish his last race.

1404
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:28,570
You just gave up the Piston Cup, you know that?

1405
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:32,240
This grumpy old racecar I know once told me somethin'.

1406
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,370
It's just an empty cup.

1407
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:39,050
Darrell, is pushing on the last lap legal?

1408
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:42,790
He's not really pushin' him. He's just givin' him a little bump draft.

1409
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:45,160
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1410
01:43:45,230 --> 01:43:47,920
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1411
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,260
That's what I call racin'.

1412
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:09,280
- Bravo il mio amico! - Way to go, buddy!

1413
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:11,950
There's a lotta love out there, you know, man?

1414
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:16,550
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore. - That's my hot rod.

1415
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:22,030
Come on, baby, bring it out! Bring out the Piston Cup!

1416
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:23,500
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1417
01:44:23,570 --> 01:44:26,540
Yeah! Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1418
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:29,730
Hey, how come the only one celebrating is me, huh?

1419
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:32,040
Where are the girls? Bring on the confetti!

1420
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:35,700
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti. What's goin' on?

1421
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:39,080
Come on, snap some pictures. I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1422
01:44:39,150 --> 01:44:40,620
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1423
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:42,310
- Boo! - Boo!

1424
01:44:42,390 --> 01:44:45,480
What's wrong with everybody? Where's the happiness?

1425
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,650
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1426
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:56,050
- Thanks, Lightnin'. - You're welcome.

1427
01:44:58,470 --> 01:45:00,900
- Way to go, King! - You're still the car!

1428
01:45:00,970 --> 01:45:02,960
You're The King! Yeah!

1429
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:16,840
- You made us proud, kid! - Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1430
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,680
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1431
01:45:22,890 --> 01:45:24,550
Thanks, Doc.

1432
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:27,030
Hey, Lightnin'.

1433
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:29,760
How 'bout comin' over here and talk to me a minute?

1434
01:45:30,670 --> 01:45:33,690
Son, that was some real racin' out there.

1435
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:36,530
How'd you like to become the new face of Dinoco?

1436
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:42,710
But I didn't win.

1437
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:46,440
Lightnin', there's a whole lot more to racin' than just winnin'.

1438
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:49,210
He was so rusty, when he drove down the street

1439
01:45:49,290 --> 01:45:53,450
buzzards used to circle the car!

1440
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,250
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1441
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:59,060
...but these Rust-eze guys over there gave me my big break.

1442
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,330
I'm gonna stick with them.

1443
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:05,460
Well, I sure can respect that.

1444
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:06,700
Still, you know,

1445
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:10,640
if there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.

1446
01:46:10,710 --> 01:46:13,230
I sure appreciate that. Thank you.

1447
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:17,700
Actually, there is one thing.

1448
01:46:18,410 --> 01:46:19,420
Whoo-hoo!

1449
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:20,640
Whoo-hoo!

1450
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:24,580
Hey, look at me! I'm flyin', by golly!

1451
01:46:29,090 --> 01:46:32,080
I'm happier than a tornado in a trailer park!

1452
01:46:35,730 --> 01:46:38,030
I think it's about-a time we redecorate.

1453
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:44,610
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me this was the best place in the world

1454
01:46:44,670 --> 01:46:45,660
to get tires.

1455
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:49,940
How 'bout setting me and my friends up with three or four sets each?

1456
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:55,210
Guido! There is a real Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1457
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,580
A real Ferrari!

1458
01:46:57,650 --> 01:46:59,780
Punch me, Guido. Punch me in the face.

1459
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:03,310
This is the most glorious day of my life.

1460
01:47:04,630 --> 01:47:08,190
Wow. Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.

1461
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:10,600
Mi dicono che siete fantastici.

1462
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,410
Just passin' through?

1463
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,780
Actually, I thought I'd stop and stay awhile.

1464
01:47:30,850 --> 01:47:34,120
- I hear this place is back on the map. - It is?

1465
01:47:34,190 --> 01:47:37,960
There's some rumor floating around that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1466
01:47:38,030 --> 01:47:40,500
is setting up his big racing headquarters here.

1467
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:43,400
Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.

1468
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:45,960
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

1469
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:50,170
Well, I create feelings in others they themselves don't understand and,

1470
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:52,400
blah, blah, blah.

1471
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:55,800
McQueen and Sally parked beneath the tree,

1472
01:47:55,880 --> 01:48:00,510
K- i-s-s... uh... i- n-t!

1473
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,850
Great timing, Mater!

1474
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:06,910
Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee!

1475
01:48:06,990 --> 01:48:09,420
He's my best friend. What're you gonna do?

1476
01:48:09,490 --> 01:48:12,430
So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

1477
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:15,190
I don't know. Why don't we just take a drive?

1478
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:17,860
Hmm... Nah.

1479
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,840
Yeah! Ka-chow!

1480
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:30,900
Ah-choo!

1481
01:49:33,710 --> 01:49:36,700
All right, everybody please keep together now.

1482
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:41,550
We is now entering the Doc Hudson wing of the museum.

1483
01:49:41,620 --> 01:49:44,590
Wow. Unbelievable. That many wins in a single season.

1484
01:49:44,650 --> 01:49:48,710
He's the real deal, Junior. The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.

1485
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:52,250
Excuse me, son. Is Doc Hudson here today?

1486
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:56,130
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc went out for a drive or somethin'.

1487
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:02,630
- Whoo! Whoo! -  Yeah!

1488
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:05,230
Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.

1489
01:50:05,310 --> 01:50:08,370
Not today, old man. I know all your tricks.

1490
01:50:12,650 --> 01:50:14,580
Doc! Doc!

1491
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,350
Whoo-ah!

1492
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:19,010
Not all my tricks, rookie!

1493
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:39,130
Attention! Kiss the pavement goodbye.

1494
01:50:39,210 --> 01:50:42,640
When I'm finished, you'll have mud in places you didn't know you had!

1495
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:46,550
- Yo, I've never been off-road! - Well, that's gonna change right now!

1496
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:49,720
About face! Drop and give me 20 miles!

1497
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:51,780
Go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

1498
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:54,690
Man, now I got dirt in my rims!

1499
01:50:57,330 --> 01:50:59,320
Huh? Look at this!

1500
01:50:59,390 --> 01:51:01,560
It's my hood! It's my hood!

1501
01:51:01,630 --> 01:51:04,720
I ain't seen this thing in 20 years!

1502
01:51:05,330 --> 01:51:09,290
Well, it fits perfectly. How do I look? Ah-choo!

1503
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:16,240
Oh, dang.

1504
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:24,940
You are a toy car!

1505
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:29,790
You are a sad, strange little wagon and you have my pity. Farewell.

1506
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:32,920
Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, you loony!

1507
01:51:32,990 --> 01:51:36,690
Hey, I hate to break up the road rally, guys, but they're here!

1508
01:51:36,770 --> 01:51:39,130
Birthday guests at three o'clock!

1509
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:42,530
Oh, man! Whoever does the voice of that piggy truck,

1510
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:45,160
I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor!

1511
01:51:45,710 --> 01:51:49,910
We're banished, genius! Stuck here in this wasteland without chains!

1512
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:53,740
But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble! She needs our help!

1513
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:58,080
- You're still not listening! - Ah!

1514
01:51:58,150 --> 01:52:01,780
Welcome to the Himalayas! Snow cone?

1515
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:05,790
Oh, that Abominable Snowplow is quite the comic thespian!

1516
01:52:06,330 --> 01:52:08,320
Just get in there. Go! Go, go, go!

1517
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:09,800
Circus cars?

1518
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:12,330
How can you be circus cars?

1519
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:14,930
These are the lousiest circus cars in the world,

1520
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,990
and they're gonna make me rich!

1521
01:52:17,070 --> 01:52:18,200
Wait a minute here.

1522
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:20,740
They're just usin' the same actor over and over.

1523
01:52:20,810 --> 01:52:23,370
What kind of a cut-rate production is this?

1524
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:53,880
Oh, for the love of Chrysler, can we please ask someone for directions?

1525
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:58,190
No! There's an on-ramp close! I know it! I can feel it!

1526
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:48,180
汽车总动员

1527
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,820
好 来吧 专心

1528
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,260
速度 我就是速度

1529
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,700
一位冠军 42位失败者

1530
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,330
我会把失败者当早餐吃掉的

1531
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,880
早餐

1532
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,040
稍等 也许我已经吃过早餐了

1533
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,810
稍微休息一下也不错 不不不 专注 加速

1534
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,750
疾上加疾 快上加快

1535
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,410
我就是“闪电”

1536
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,850
喂 “闪电” 准备好了吗

1537
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,660
喔耶 “闪电”已经准备好了

1538
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,030
咔嚓

1539
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,210
卖天线球喔

1540
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,950
冲啊 “闪电”

1541
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,020
- 哇喔  - 说的没错 伙计

1542
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,540
啊

1543
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,860
欢迎回到狄纳哥400

1544
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,560
我是鲍伯凯特拉斯 以及我的好友岱洛卡崔普

1545
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,620
赛车史上一场至关重要的比赛正在进行之中

1546
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,730
鲍伯 我的油压现在高到不行

1547
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,400
如果再继续这样剌激下去 我就得被拖吊出去了

1548
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,530
没错 岱洛

1549
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,240
三位选手以平分的方式

1550
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,400
进入今年的总决赛

1551
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,250
赢得这场比赛的人 不仅得到年度总冠军 更将得到活塞杯

1552
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,010
绰号“国王”的选手史崔普惠特

1553
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,490
会在退役之前再得到一项冠军吗？

1554
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,150
他一向都是狄纳哥的常胜将军

1555
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,420
他能否再赢一次活塞杯呢？

1556
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,860
像往常一样 别忘了第二名的选手奇克希克斯

1557
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,450
他的整个职业生涯 都一直紧咬着“国王”不放

1558
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,690
奇克认为今年时机已到

1559
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,530
也许他可以从“国王”的阴影下走出来

1560
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,660
但他意想不到的是 “闪电”麦坤

1561
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,370
我想大家都没预料到这种情况

1562
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,070
赛季开始时麦坤只是个无名小卒

1563
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,640
但现在没有人不认识他了

1564
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,780
他会成为第一个赢得 活塞杯的新人并入主迪纳哥吗？

1565
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,450
传奇“国王” 凶猛“路霸” 新人“闪电”

1566
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,390
三辆赛车 一个冠军

1567
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,060
你休想

1568
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,770
嘿

1569
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,650
开得太棒了

1570
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,250
追上去 麦坤  追上去

1571
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,890
我爱你 “闪电”

1572
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,620
迪纳哥是我的

1573
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,630
第三个弯脚处有麻烦了

1574
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,930
- 看你怎么过来 麦坤 - 领先者的后面发生了大碰撞

1575
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,690
等等 岱洛 麦坤冲进了混乱之中

1576
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,590
他不可能穿过那里的

1577
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,890
他会被撞烂的

1578
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,210
耶

1579
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,250
“闪电” 喔

1580
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,620
快看啊 麦坤冲出来了

1581
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,160
“闪电”麦坤又一次上演精彩表演

1582
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,350
耶 咔嚓

1583
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,690
“闪电” “闪电” “闪电”  “闪电” “闪电” “闪电”

1584
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,730
耶 麦坤 咔嚓

1585
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,030
当大家都进入维修站的时候

1586
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,860
只有麦坤留在赛道上保持领先

1587
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,930
别把我拖出去 教练 我还能比赛

1588
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,150
觉得怎么样？漂亮吧

1589
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,150
- 麦坤出来了  - 什么？

1590
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,270
他没有进站

1591
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,480
你们得让我出去 快点 我要去追他

1592
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,320
麦坤没有进站

1593
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,950
这个新人解雇了他的领队 这赛季的第三个了

1594
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,320
- 看起来他喜欢单干 - 冲 冲啊

1595
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,620
看来奇克在维修站里耽误了不少时间

1596
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,100
对呀 像这样的的停站 他有的路要赶了

1597
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,570
准备好 伙计们 比赛要重新开始了

1598
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,550
让开 让开 让开

1599
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,020
我们需要换胎  伙计们 快点

1600
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,800
- 不 不 不 不 不要换胎 只要加油 - 什么？

1601
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,990
你需要新轮胎呀 白痴

1602
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,310
看来麦坤今天只加油就好了

1603
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,810
对呀 又不换轮胎

1604
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,570
通常那只会给你带来短暂的优势 但之后会害了你的

1605
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,310
不过看起来这对麦坤不适用 嘿 看来他比我们懂的还多

1606
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,660
快结束了 岱洛 比赛剩下最后一圈 麦坤领先了一大截

1607
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,590
他的冠军已经手到擒来了 可以把啦啦队叫出来欢呼了吧

1608
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,960
我们有一个新冠军了

1609
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,670
终点线 我来啦

1610
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,730
糟糕 麦坤爆胎了

1611
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,540
只剩最后一个弯 他到的了吗？

1612
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,170
你这个笨蛋

1613
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,020
麦坤爆胎了 他爆胎了

1614
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,580
快追快追

1615
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,490
他又爆了另一个胎

1616
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,800
- “国王”和“路霸”快速拉近距离  - 他们一起进入三号弯脚

1617
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,730
加油

1618
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,840
真是难以置信 鲍伯

1619
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,440
“闪电”麦坤和他的活塞杯奖座只差一百尺

1620
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,780
“国王”和“路霸”过了四号个弯

1621
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,920
最后一段了 冠军是...冠军是

1622
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,790
- 太紧凑了 相差太小了 - 简直不敢相信

1623
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,230
“闪电”

1624
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,520
- 最最引人入胜 最最精彩的... - 真不敢相信

1625
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,060
史上最精彩的结局

1626
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,160
- 我们都不知道谁获得了冠军  - 看啊

1627
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,880
- 这太接近了 - 能再放一遍吗？

1628
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,150
嘿 不准拍照 出去

1629
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,760
我们在冠军通道等待最终结果

1630
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,290
麦坤 刚才你不换车胎实在是太大胆了

1631
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,350
你倒是说说

1632
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,090
你会不会后悔 你没有维修团队呢

1633
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,600
喔 可莉 赛车不是只顾输赢就好的

1634
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,570
如果我轻易的领先一整圈夺冠 那还有什么意思

1635
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,570
我要给观众们剌激感呀

1636
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,770
- 剌激？ - 我会后悔没有维修队吗？

1637
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,000
不 当然不会 因为我自己一人就搞定了

1638
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,510
什么？喔 好吧

1639
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,640
真有自信的“闪电”麦坤

1640
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,340
从终点线为您带来的时况转播 我是可莉特布瓦茨

1641
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,110
- 喂 闪开 - 嘿 查克

1642
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,880
查克你在干嘛？ 你挡住摄影机了

1643
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,950
- 大家都想看闪电 - 什么？

1644
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,620
- 退后退后 - 就是这样 快 伙计们

1645
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,750
- 唉呀 你们这是干嘛 - 我们不干了你 自己一人搞定吧

1646
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,530
喔喔 随便吧

1647
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,370
要再找到一个能 帮我加油的人很难吗？

1648
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,410
- 再见 查克 - 我不叫查克

1649
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,140
哦 随便吧

1650
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,230
喂 麦坤 叫你呢 麦坤

1651
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,610
刚才的比赛可真漂亮啊

1652
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,910
- 我是说我  - 嗯 好吧

1653
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,510
- 太棒了  - 欢迎来到奇克时代

1654
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,250
不过活塞杯是我的 伙计 是我的

1655
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,880
我觉得迪纳哥蓝蛮适合我的 迪纳哥蓝

1656
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,790
你做你的白日梦吧 “雷”先生

1657
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,960
哈 没错 “雷”？ 他干嘛叫我“雷”？

1658
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,870
喔 你知道 打雷一向都是在闪电之后啊

1659
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,730
咔乒 咔乓

1660
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,240
- 你们谁了解雷吗？ - 不清楚

1661
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,000
- 我们要闪电  - 这就对了

1662
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,540
往右转 对着镜头

1663
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,870
- 伙计 秀一下闪电  - 笑一个 麦坤

1664
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,240
- 秀一下闪电 麦坤  - 就是这样

1665
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,010
比赛结果太接近了 迪纳哥以你为荣

1666
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,080
谢谢你 “国王”

1667
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,920
泰仕 这些年你一直对我很好

1668
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,360
我只是尽全力去比赛而已

1669
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,660
不管结果怎样 你永远都是我的冠军

1670
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,530
谢了 亲爱的 没有你我什么都做不成

1671
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,300
咔嚓

1672
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,030
- 我是蜜亚 - 我是蒂亚

1673
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,370
我们是你的头号粉丝  咔嚓

1674
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,940
我爱做自己

1675
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,110
- 好了 女孩们 可以了 - 我们爱你 “闪电”

1676
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,920
小子 你真是个胆大的选手

1677
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,550
噢 “国王”先生你好

1678
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,420
你拥有的天份是其它选手

1679
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,050
一辈子都得不到的

1680
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,720
- 是吗？这个... - 可是你太笨了

1681
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,360
- 什么？ - 小子 赛车不是独角戏

1682
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,530
你得变聪明点 去找个好的团队

1683
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,630
没有好的团队帮你 你是不可能赢的

1684
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,000
你要让他们做好他们的工作

1685
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,810
- 就像我告诉孩子们在商店里 - 好的团队

1686
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,780
没错

1687
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,080
咔嚓 咔乓

1688
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,870
哦 “闪电”

1689
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,150
你要是能解决这些问题 就会变得更好了

1690
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,840
嗯 好吧 谢谢你的关心与建议

1691
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,350
谢谢你 “国王”先生

1692
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,510
女士们先生们

1693
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,820
今天是活塞杯历史上 我们第一次

1694
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,590
一个新手赢得活塞杯

1695
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,050
没错

1696
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,070
...结果是三人平手

1697
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,770
嘿 麦坤 很尴尬吧

1698
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,510
不过我不会想太多的 因为尴尬的不是我 哈哈

1699
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,980
主办单位决定三位平手的选手

1700
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,280
一个礼拜后在加州进行殊死赛

1701
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,790
谢谢 谢谢你们 谢谢

1702
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,560
小子 看谁先到加州谁就可得到迪纳哥

1703
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,600
不 不是我 你才酷

1704
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,100
喔耶 太棒了

1705
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,300
嗯 好吧

1706
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,830
谁先到加州谁就得到迪纳哥

1707
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,540
我倒要来看看是谁先到 奇克

1708
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,710
嗯？

1709
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,120
- 小子 恭喜你得到平手 - 别说了

1710
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,050
我们走吧 麦大叔 你把我的车厢拿到哪去了？

1711
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,320
- 我把它停在你的赞助商的蓬子里了 - 什么？

1712
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,380
你得去那边露个脸

1713
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,020
不不不 不要啊

1714
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,560
是的是的 我是闪电麦坤

1715
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,260
我用“锈不来”保险杠防锈药膏

1716
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,030
“锈不来”保护你已经生锈的保险杠 不再锈下去

1717
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,870
哇 看看这个光泽

1718
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,670
用“锈不来”你也可以跟我一样亮

1719
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,010
咔嚓

1720
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,270
我在沼泽地见过这辆车

1721
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,410
他已经锈到不成个样子了

1722
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,360
你从车顶都可以看到他的底盘了

1723
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,660
唉 我恨生锈的车子 这有损我的形象

1724
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,130
至少他们帮你出了赞助费 你必须帮他们打广告

1725
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,100
拜托别说了行吗？ 去把车厢接起来吧

1726
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,130
- 冬天是个可怕的东西 - 不用猜测 不用怀疑

1727
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,640
不过记住 所有的盐份和污渍

1728
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,680
会把你的螺丝锈掉 也会把你冻坏

1729
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,710
嘿 你们看 他来了

1730
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,750
我们的准冠军

1731
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,480
快过来坐

1732
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,580
“闪电”麦坤 你真是太快了

1733
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,810
- 这种比赛小意思 - 你是真正的冠军

1734
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,950
- 拜托让让路 - 你是我的偶像

1735
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,850
我知道

1736
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,480
谢谢 弗列德

1737
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,150
他知道我名字 他知道我名字

1738
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,190
你气色不错啊 弗列德

1739
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,730
谢谢你 “闪电” 今年我们业绩好多了

1740
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,330
我们的盈余还可帮你买个车头灯

1741
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,430
你是说他没有车头灯？

1742
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,840
对呀 他的车头灯其实是贴纸

1743
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,900
好吧 你们应该知道 赛车是不需要车头灯的

1744
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,970
因为赛场永远都是亮的

1745
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,240
我的兄弟们和你不一样 他们还是要头灯

1746
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,920
- 女士们先生们 - “闪电”麦坤

1747
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,830

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,880
- 嘿 小子 - 我们爱你

1754
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,420
期待明年和你的合作

1755
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,780
就像今年一样

1756
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,660
那是不可能的事

1757
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,450
- 不要像我兄弟一样开车 - 没错 不要想他那样

1758
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,520

1762
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,910
这是世上最棒的经纪人哈夫吗？

1763
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,750
能当你的经纪人真是我的荣幸

1764
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,850
我都不太好意思要抽你10%的佣金

1765
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:40,020
总之 真是场漂亮的比赛

1766
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,590

我想停下来喘口气 孩子

1782
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,310
- 老麦需要休息休息 - 这可不行

1783
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,110
我们要熬夜开到加州 我们说好了的

1784
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,380
熬夜？你知道交通部规定不可

1785

1803
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,340

1823
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,860
他在对我开枪 为什么他要射我？

1824
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,300
我好多年没开这么快了

1825

我引擎快爆了

1826
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,610

00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,970
他是个疯子

1829
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,570
我跟你说 每次闪第三下时就特别慢

1830
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,750
60年代对你的影响不好 对吧？

1831
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,360
什么？前面不是州际公路

1832
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,300

飞吧 史丹利 飞向自由

1842
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,950
小子 你的麻烦大了

1843
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,120
记者现在洛杉矶国际赛道为您实况转播

1844
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,720
第一位选手“闪电”麦坤

1845
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,090
现在已经到达了

1846
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,100
他要去和赛车女郎约会的事是真的吗？

1847
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,330
你的战略是什么？

1848
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:43,070
怎么啦？我忘了擦我的挡泥板吗？

1849
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,970
麦柛的司机到了加州 但麦坤却失踪了

1850
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,000
赛车“闪电麦坤”失踪 而他却应该在几天后参加空前的比赛

1851
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,640
赞助商公开声明不知道他在哪里

1852
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,080
我希望“闪电”没事 希望他别碰上了麻烦

1853
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,360
不知道谁比较难找 “闪电”麦坤或是他的维修队长

1854
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,520
我们一定要尽全力找到“闪电”麦坤

1855
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,560
每个人都在问相同的问题 麦坤在哪里？

1856
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,700
哦 伙计

1857
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,830

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,500
- 早啊 睡美人  - 啊

1859
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,700
我去烧个水你就醒过来了

1860
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,480
你想要什么都给你 不要伤害我

1861
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,450
轮胎锁？ 为什么我的轮胎被锁上了

1862
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,480
- 发生了什么事？ - 你真有意思

1863
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,620
我已经开始喜欢你了 我叫脱线

1864
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,120
脱线？

1865
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,130
对呀 就像少根筋的意思

1866
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,470
- 你叫什么名字？ - 你不知道我名字？

1867
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,530
呃...

1868
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,010
不知道...你也叫脱线？

1869
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,100

1870
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,940
我必须要赶去加州 我现在在哪里？

1871
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,280
你在哪里？啊哈

1872
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,910

1873
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,390
这是一个漂亮的小镇

1874
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,320
噢 太棒了 真是太棒了

1875
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,920
如果你觉得这样就棒的话 你该去看看镇上其它地方

1876
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,800
说真的 我很想去看看其它地方

1877
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,830
所以你把门打开 解开我的锁

1878
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,630
我们两个一起去逛逛吧看看附近的好景点

1879
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,940
- 太棒了 - 会是什么样的景色呢？

1880
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,530
- 酷  - 脱线

1881
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,480
我不是叫你不要跟犯人说话的嘛？

1882
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,040
不说话

1883
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,550
那你就快闭嘴 把他拖去交通法庭吧

1884
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,710
好吧 我们晚点再聊 脱线

1885
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,650
再聊 脱线 真好笑

1886
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,910
啊

1887
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,690
油车水镇交通法院 现在开庭

1888
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,290
嘿 你刮坏了我的漆  我要揍扁你

1889
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,770
你把道路弄坏了  你是一辆罪恶深重的车

1890
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,860
- 法西斯  - 共产党

1891
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,630
警官 你能不能告诉我这要开多久

1892
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,470
我必须赶去加州

1893
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,700
你的律师呢？

1894
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,040
不知道 大概跑去大溪地了吧 他在那边租了个渡假村

1895
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:07,240
他如果被控没有律师的话 法院将指派一位律师给他

1896
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,310
喂 有没有人想当他的律师啊？

1897
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,020
好吧 让我来 韩大夫

1898
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,860
起立 今天的法官是韩大夫

1899
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,320
炫耀狂

1900
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,730
祷告韩大夫对你手下留情吧

1901
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,990
好啊

1902
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,190
我想知道 到底是谁把我的镇搞成这样

1903
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,170
我要把他的引擎盖拆下来

1904
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,900
我要把他关在牢里直到他腐烂

1905
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,740
我要把他关在牢里 直到监狱都垮下来

1906
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,470
然后把他移到另一个监狱 直到另一个监狱也垮下来

1907
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,070
我还要

1908
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,990
把他丢出去 警长

1909
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,420
把他丢出我的法庭 把他赶出我的镇

1910
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,150
- 结案 - 太好了

1911
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,490
嘿 我这个辩护律师做得不错嘛

1912
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,030
不好意思我迟到了 法官大人

1913
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,060
哇 保时捷 她一定是我的律师派来的

1914
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,600
喂 谢谢你赶来 不过这案子已经解决了

1915
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,100
- 他无罪释放了我 - 他无罪释放你？

1916
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,110
对呀 你今天的工作轻松吧

1917
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:08,340
你现在只要站在那边让我好好看着你

1918
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,970

- 拜托  - 没关系 我了解你的感受

1921
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,810
我常常让别人感受到前所未有的感觉

1922
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,550
啊 哦

1923
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,030
不好意思 我吓到你了吗？

1924
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,120
有一点 不过我没事

1925
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,960

1926
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,630
去吧 宝贝 不过小心点

1927
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,400
这里的人脑袋都有点秀逗 如果你知道我的意思

1928
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,470
咔嚓

1929
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,630

1931
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,280
- 你好啊 脱线 - 你好呀 莎莉

1932
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,950
- 大家好 - 早安

1933
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,670
你认识她？

1934
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,720
她是镇上的律师 也是我的未婚妻

1935
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,780
什么？

1936
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,950
开玩笑的 她只喜欢我的外表

1937
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:01,860
韩大夫 您今天看起来真帅 你是不是改装了你的后照镜？

1938
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,590
你到底想说什么 莎莉

1939
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,030
求求你 判他修理被破坏的道路 我们镇上需要道路啊

1940
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,270
不行 我看多了他这种人 赛车

1941
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,400
这镇上最不需要的就是赛车

1942
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,970
好吧 我本来不想这样 是你逼我的

1943
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,980
各位好市民 你们一定都熟悉这镇上 令人引以为傲的历史吧

1944
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,480
她又来了

1945
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,250
油车水镇

1946
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,950
是俗称道路之母的66号公路上

1947
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,820
一颗闪亮的宝石 我们有权利也有义务

1948
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,890
- 照顾所有穿过这城镇的旅行者 - 旅行者？什么旅行者？

1949
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,130
不要理他

1950
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,570
可是我问你们 现在路被弄坏了 我们要怎么照顾这些旅行者

1951
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,970
如果没有路给他们开了？

1952
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,840
- 路易奇 你的店里卖什么？ - 轮胎

1953
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,400
但如果没有路可以到达你的店呢？

1954
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,810
那我的轮胎就卖不出去 我什么都没有了

1955
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,710
- 芙蓉 你的店里卖什么？ - 我卖汽油

1956
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,180
- 很多汽油  - 好的 伙计们 听我说

1957
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,780
芙蓉 如果没有人能到达你的店加油呢？

1958
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,350
那我会 被迫关店而搬走

1959
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,560
如果芙蓉关了加油站搬走了我们怎么办？

1960
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,190
- 没有汽油 我们也不能动了 - 什么？

1961
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,100
所以你们不觉得闯祸的人 应该负责修理吗？

1962
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,400
可是唯一够强壮修路的人是大阿尔呀

1963
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,700
丽姬 阿尔15年前就搬走了

1964
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,800
那你干嘛还提他的名字？

1965
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,870
哦 他能办到

1966
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,740
没问题的 他可以修路 他马力足够 所以你们想要他做什么？

1967
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,280
修理马路

1968
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,910
- 因为我们的城镇是值得修补的  - 没错

1969
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,520
肃静

1970
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:39,060
看来有人帮我改变了决定

1971
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,120
- 好哇 - 不要啊

1972
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,530
判得好

1973
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,760
我不邀请你共进晚餐了

1974
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,700
哈 没关系 你可以带贝茜去

1975
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,600
哇 你可以跟贝茜共事

1976
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,300
我也好希望能跟她一起工作

1977
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,040
贝茜？贝茜是谁？

1978
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:04,210
这就是贝茜 镇上最好的铺路机

1979
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,350
我现在判你做社区服务

1980
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,150
你要在我的监督下修理马路

1981
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,560
什么 这是什么鬼地方

1982
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,790
喂 我知道现在提这个不好

1983
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,860
可是你欠我三万两千元律师费

1984
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,920
什么？

1985
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,560
我们会把贝茜接在你后面 你要对她温柔点

1986
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,230
开什么玩笑

1987
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,970
你从路的那头开始

1988
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,340
然后到路的那头结束

1989
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,580
天哪

1990
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,520
喂 喂 喂 这样要做多久？

1991
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,150
只要不下雨的话 大概五天

1992
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,380
五天？

1993
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,390
我现在应该已经在加州 谈迪纳哥的事呢

1994
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,430
那你更该赶快闭嘴开始工作

1995
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,990
- 把他接起来吧 脱线 - 好的好的

1996
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,300
自由啦

1997
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,140
也许我该先把他接上贝茜

1998
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,220
再解开锁的

1999
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,090

00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,040
我怎么会没油了

2007
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,080
小子 我们没你想像中那么笨

00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,490

00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,730
- 他们在原来的地方比较好 - [意大利语]

2015
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,680
- 戈里多 - 小红 你能不能移过去一点

2016
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,580
我想看看那台性感赛车

2017
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,480
你知道吗 我以前也是蛮风光的

2018
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,280
当然现在不成啦

2019
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,260
老啰 引擎积水 不中用啰

2020
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,690
韩大夫说他会帮我修理 他什么都能修

2021
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,990
就是这样我们才选他做法官的

2022
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,330
孩子 你应该听我说过了

2023
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,770
我可没吹牛

2024
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,140
别人都大老远来看我

2025
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,630

他呀 他有点害羞嘛 而且他很气你把他的花搞砸了

2035
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,530
为什么我要受这种气

2036
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,470
我是一个结合速度与流线的精密仪器

2037
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,570
- 你“遗弃”什么？ - 我是一辆很有名的赛车

2038
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,040
你是有名的赛车？真的赛车？

对呀 当然是真的 不然咧 瞧瞧我

2040

那你一定认识我 我是“闪电”麦坤

2042

- “闪电”麦坤？ - 是啊 没错

00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,420
我高兴得想尖叫

2044
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:36,730
这实在太剌激了

2045
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,290
- 你认识很多法拉利吗？ - 不不不不不

2046
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:42,340
他们是在欧洲的赛道比赛 我是在活塞杯

2047
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,040
- 什么？ - 路易奇只看法拉利赛车

不用问 我知道该怎么走

喂喂喂喂

2093
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,770
- 我知道怎么到州际公路 - 是吗

2094
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,510
- 米妮 不要理他 - 对啊对啊

2095
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,050
呃 其实我不知道 听着

2096
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,750
我是“闪电”麦坤 著名的赛车 我被强制拘禁在这里

2097
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,350
你们要帮我个忙 打给我的队员 叫他们来教我

2098
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,260
我才能赶回加州 参加活塞杯 明白吗？

2099
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,490
不不不不不不不

2100
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,430
是真的啊 不骗你 你们一定要帮我离开这儿

2101
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,660
这个满是乡巴佬的小镇 我的IQ在直线下降

2102
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,830
我要变得跟他们一样了

2103
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,840
别烦恼了 他们知道我们在哪里了

2104
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,670
他们会帮我们宣传的 等着瞧吧

2105
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,610
“闪电”麦坤还是不见踪影

2106
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,410
很好 自活塞杯赛事升级之后

2107
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,390
仍然没有“闪电”麦坤 到达加州的迹象

2108
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,910
今天第一辆赛车已经开始适应场地了

2109
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,160
这种领先别人先到赛场的感觉真棒

2110
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:58,000
你知道嘛 领先一步 是个好采头

2111
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,230
哈哈哈

2112
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,300
哈哈

2113
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,140
耶

2114
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,090
喂 麦坤 别太伤心了

2115
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,390
哦

2116
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,830
我直说吧

2117
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,840
我把路修好就可以走了 对吧？

2118
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,630
- 对啊 他们是这么说的 - 好 让路让路

2119
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,800
我要修路了

2120
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:54,050
- 他修完了 - 修完了？

2121
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,490
- 是啊 - 才过一个小时而已

2122
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,760
啊 我做完了 做完了

2123
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,700
现在你们只要跟我道谢 我就走人了

2124
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,960
哈 我第一个开在新路上

2125
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,130
哦

2126
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,170
看起来好丑啊

2127
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,870
- 看上去好难看  - 跟你们这个镇蛮配的

2128
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,470
哦

2129
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,840
小红

2130
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,790
你以为你是谁啊

2131
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,160
喂 韩大夫说我做完后我就可以走的

2132
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,660
我说的是把路铺好 不是弄得更糟

2133
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,200
把它刮起来 重铺一遍

2134
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:41,900
老爹 我可不是铲土机 我是个赛车耶

2135
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,460
哇喔

2136
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:47,770
是吗？要不我们来个比赛怎么样？ 就我们两个

2137
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,640
- 什么？ - 我跟你 你在开玩笑吗？

2138
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,080
如果你赢了 你就可以走 我自己修路

2139
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:56,850
如果我赢的话 你得照我的方式修路

2140
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,440
韩大夫 你在说什么呀

2141
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,650
不好意思喔

2142
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,450
不过你从0到60里恐怕要开个3年半吧

2143
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,050
那我想你应该没什么好怕的吧

2144
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:11,790
好吧 既然你这么说 那就来比一场吧

2145
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,060
两位 这场比赛只有一圈

2146
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,630
你们要开到威利丘 绕过丘再折返回来

2147
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,640
不可以碰撞 做弊吐口水

2148
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,240
不许咬人 发飙 乱放油 推拖

2149
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:31,450
不许暗箭伤人 独占道路

2150
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,280
不许横冲直撞

2151
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,910
速度 我就是速度

2152
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:37,550
壮如凯迪拉克 快如宝马

2153
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:43,590
我的梦想就是参与赛车比赛

2154
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,190
- 加油维修区  - 呃...

2155
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,140
伙计 这场比赛只有一圈

2156
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,700
一圈而已 不需要你们的帮忙

2157
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:55,610
- 有我就搞定了 - 哼 随便你

2158
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,780
- 不用加油维修 了解吗？ - 好吧

2159
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,870
两位

2160
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,350
发动你们的引擎

2161
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,490
- 都看看吧  - 哇

2162
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,660
好主意 韩大夫 现在路永远修不好了

2163
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,330
路易奇？

2164
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,600
各就各位 预备 开始

2165
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,900
为了奖金 应该秀一下了

2166
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:31,670
准备 难以置信 冲啊

2167
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,490
嗯？

2168
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,650
韩大夫 摇旗就是说冲啊

2169
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,060
没错 摇旗 我们出发吧 出发

2170
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,860
韩大夫 你在干嘛

2171
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:54,490
真糟 看来我晚了一步

2172
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,700
不过再迟也比不跑好 走吧 脱线

2173
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,540
- 可能需要你的帮忙 - 呃...好吧

2174
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,680
你有带拖吊工具吧？

2175
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,940
当然有啦 为什么？

2176
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:08,310
只是预防万一

2177
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,050
哇噢哇噢 噢 噢 噢 噢 噢

2178
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:20,860

- 哦  - 够糟的吧 伙计

2181
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:35,600
嘿 这就是你说的“重”如凯迪拉克 或是“笨”如宝马跑车？

2182
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,040
我搞糊涂了

2183
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,210
你开车就像你修路一样

2184
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,480
技术真糙 玩笑开够了 脱线

2185
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,120
啊

2186
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,830
原来韩大夫早就知道你会失控

2187
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,020
谢了 脱线 谢谢

2188
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,070
那种小弯对我应该不算什么啊

2189
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,570
你觉得呢？

2190
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,100
不 我又浪费了一天 我是不是永远逃不出这里了

2191
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,640
嘿 放松点 你需要新的烤漆 伙计

2192
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,680
- 不了 谢谢 - 有机燃料呢？

2193
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,110
- 那恶心的果汁？ - 算了吧

2194
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:19,640
唔 看他工作的样子让我口干舌燥 有没有人要喝饮料呀？

2195
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,310
不用了 芙蓉

2196
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,860
因为我是一个特殊机器

2197
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:28,520
我是结合速度与“空洞”的精密仪器

2198
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,360
“你开车像你修路”

2199
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:36,200
我会 给他好看

2200
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:48,880
气死我啦

2201
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:52,580
- 气死了 气死了 气死了  - 这声音真是太美妙了

2202
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:56,350
也许这么做不太好

2203
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,150
油车水镇 快乐的地方

2204
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:02,250

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,330
- 我们走走吧 宝贝 - 慢慢开

2214

[意大利语]天啊 真漂亮

2215
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,410
好像是天使们铺的路

2216
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,650
孩子们 我告诉你们

2217
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,550
我打赌月亮上的路都没有这条平坦

2218
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,280
韩大夫 来看啊

2219
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,290
早该判他修路了吧？

2220
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,850
嗯 还早呢 还有很长一段路没完成

2221

看看路易奇

2222
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,230
看起来太棒了

2223
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,760
很好玩的样子 脱线 换我玩啦

2224
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,140
喂 路易奇 这条新路 让你的店看起来像垃圾场

2225
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:23,510
哼 那疯婆子

2226
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,380
喔

2227
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:29,280
她说的对

2228
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:30,910
- 啊  - 戈里多

2229
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:34,750
哈 那小子干得不错啊

2230
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:39,820
不过 他跑哪去啦？

2231
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,900
警长 他又想偷溜了吗？

2232
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:52,340
不不不 他做到半夜时柏油用完了

2233
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:54,770
他问我能不能出来这里

2234
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,240
他想要再试过那个弯

2235
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,150
不不不 哇呀

2236
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:03,140
我一直试图在弯道跑出完美的弧线

2237
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,310
警长 你要不要去芙蓉那喝杯汽油

2238
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:10,790
我帮你看着他

2239
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:14,760
谢了 韩大夫 我正觉得有点口渴

2240
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,610
这不是柏油路 这是泥路

2241
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,410
唉 你又想要干嘛 你是来炫耀的吗？

2242
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,820
在泥地里煞车没用 你不能踩煞车

2243
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:41,380
你得用油门来控制 过弯时记得放油门

2244
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,520
如果你开太快的话就会滑出去

2245
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:47,690
原来你不只是法官 还是个赛车高手

2246
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,420
我简单说吧

2247
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,660
如果你用力左转的话 你会发现你开始往右转

2248
00:49:54,740 --> 00:50:00,140
是吗 那可真有意思 向右转却可以向左开 谢谢

2249
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,010
或者我应该说 不 谢谢

2250
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,670
因为在一个相反的世界里 那就代表谢谢你

2251
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,880
脑子有问题的老爷车

2252
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,460
向右转却可以向左开

2253
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,720
呃...

2254
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,860
哇

2255
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,670
啊

2256
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,100
啊 这是...

2257
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,040
啊

2258
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,750
向右转却可以向左开 我试过了

2259
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:46,910
神奇的事发生了 我向右开了

2260
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:50,390
如果你总是自言自语 人们会以为你是个疯子

2261
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,390
- 谢谢你的提醒 - 什么 我没在同你说话

2262
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:04,830
- [意大利语] - [意大利语]

2263
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:09,280
- 看上去太棒了 太棒了  - [意大利语]

2264
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,870
哦 天啊

2265
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,580
脱线

2266
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,810
我想让你今晚看管那个囚犯

2267
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:21,180
没问题 如果他又想逃跑怎么办？

2268
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,090
那就让他跑到没油 再把他拖回来

2269
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,630
- 你一定要一只眼睛紧紧盯住他 - 是 长官

2270
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,390
呃...

2271
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,130
我被困在这里修这条破路

2272
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,760
“路霸”却在加州争取加入迪纳哥

2273
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,100
我的迪纳哥 哇哇哇 谁在碰我？

2274
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,470
路易奇正在给你修理

2275
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,570

2277

如果你买四个轮胎 我就给你免费全身修理

2279
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:55,090
- 全部免费  - 瞧 我所用的所有轮胎都是免费的

你为什么这么对我？

2298
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,670
- 你到底想不想住在舒适小锥里？ - 嗯？

2299
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,240
如果你想 你必须洗干净

2300
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,840
就算在这农村人的地方 我们也有我们的准则

2301
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,650
什么？我...我不明白

2302
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,310
我只是想感谢你所做的一切

2303
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:03,620
所以我想让你和我住在一起 不 不是和我在一起

2304
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:08,320
是在那边 不是和我住在一个房间 你住在你的房间

2305

- 我住在我的房间 - 等一等 你现在对我这么好

2306
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:14,730
如果你想呆在肮脏的拘留所里 没问题

00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,070
- 我了解你这种罪犯 - 不不不 那很好

2308

- 舒适小锥很好 - 这里刚刚重新装修过

2309
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:24,870
把旅馆建成汽车见到会躲避的

2310
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:29,080
警示标真是一个好主意

2311
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:32,520
现在我们要住在那里 真是可笑

2312
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,250
全是你自己想出来的 对不对？

2313
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:39,690
你想来 就住在一号房间里

2314
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,160

非常的漂亮

2321
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:12,090
就像捷豹 唯一不同的是 她是一辆卡车

2322
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,650
我总是为了和她说话而去撞她

2323
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,230
- 你到底在说什么？ - 我也不知道

2324
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:23,430
我想到一些我们晚上可以做的有趣的事 因为今天晚上我负责看管你

2325
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,670

你偷偷的走到他们面前 然后鸣喇叭

2340
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,810
他们会做剩下的部分 瞧着吧

2341
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,690

01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,620
那不仅仅是一场比赛 我们是在说活塞杯啊

2400
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:15,020
这是我一生的梦想

2401
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:18,120
我会成为历史上唯一一个 赢得活塞杯的新车手

2402
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:21,760
当我赢了之后 我就会得到新的赞助商

2403
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,490
还有私人直升机

2404
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:26,830
再也不会见到保险杠清洁剂 和老到生锈的车了

2405
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:29,030
老到生锈的车怎么了？

2406
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,470
我不是在说你 拖线 我是在说其它的老爷车

2407
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:37,710
- 不是像你这样的 我喜欢你 - 没关系 兄弟

2408
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:42,750
我可不可以有一天 坐一坐你的直升飞机？

2409
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:47,410
我总是梦想着坐一坐 那些漂亮的直升飞机

2410
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:50,290
- 当然可以 - 真的吗？

2411
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,120
当然了 你说什么都行

2412
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,160
我就知道我的选择是对的

2413
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:58,060
什么选择？

2414
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:00,900
我最好的朋友

2415
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,070
明早见

2416
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:12,600
麦坤和莎莉停在树旁边

2417
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:16,350
亲亲 亲亲

2418
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:21,780
哇哇哇

2419
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:29,060
一号 一号 一号到了

2420
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:32,560
- 啊 真不错 - 嘿 小子

2421
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,760
- 不好意思 - 你吓到我了 你得当心一点

2422
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,970
我也吓到了我自己

2423
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,140
- 我并不是因为害怕而害怕 - 不 当然不是

2424
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:44,940
- 我只是 - 我听到你和拖线的对话了

2425
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:47,740
什么时候？刚刚吗？你听到了什么？

2426
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,810
关于坐直升飞机的事

2427
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,050
没错 他非常想坐

2428
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,020
- 你是认真的吗？ - 什么？

2429
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:57,120
- 你会让他坐你的直升飞机 - 谁知道呢？

2430
01:01:57,190 --> 01:02:00,220
首先 我必须先离开这里去参加比赛

2431
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,290
呃

2432
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,560
你知道吗 拖线信任你

2433
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:09,300
好吧

2434
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:12,070
- 你现在说的话是认真的吗？ - 怎么了？

2435
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:17,770
你是想敷衍我 还是真心实意

2436
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:20,510
我今天已经很累了 感觉上过了很长的一天

2437
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:24,080
好吧 晚安

2438
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,680
哦...

2439
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,950
嘿 谢谢

2440
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,920
你说什么？

2441
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:36,830
谢谢你让我住在这里

2442
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,770
这里比拘留所强多了 而且...很舒服

2443
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,400
- 新装修的 对不对？ - 没错

2444
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:47,830
- 晚安 - 晚安

2445
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,540
嗯

2446
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:12,050
你可不可以把那 国旗音乐给关了

2447
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:15,960
要懂得经典 这是亨德里克斯

2448
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,470
啊

2449
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:36,010
不

2450
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:45,490
不

2451
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,300
我一定要离开这里

2452
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:50,700
你见到警长了吗？ 上帝啊

2453
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:54,030
- 你来这里干什么？ - 吓到你了吗 城里人？

2454
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:57,600
我只是想要我今天需要的汽油

2455
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,800
在芙蓉那里等着 现在离开这里

2456
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,540
我想离开这里已经有三天了

2457
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:05,110
我希望你喜欢这里

2458
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,490
韩大夫

2459
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:24,300
该整理一下车库了

2460
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:41,980
什么？

2461
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:45,890
他有活塞杯？

2462
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,730
我的天啊

2463
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,130
三座活塞杯

2464
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:12,440
门上写着禁止入内

2465
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:15,880
你有三个活塞杯 你怎么

2466
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:19,050
我只知道你不会开车 我还不知道你还不识字

2467
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,150
- 你是哈德逊大黄蜂  - 在芙蓉那里等着 照我说的做

2468
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:24,750
我真不敢相信我以前没认出你来

2469
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:26,560
你是最棒的哈德逊大黄蜂

2470
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:30,290
你还保持着一个赛季 最多胜利场数的纪录 我们得谈谈

2471
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:33,100
- 你一定要告诉我你的技巧 - 我已经告诉过你了

2472
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:35,900
你赢过三次冠军 看看那些奖杯

2473
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:39,410
你看 我只看到一些没用的杯子

2474
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:49,950
做一些汽车瑜珈可以降低你的转速

2475
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,820
去洗一下车吧 嬉皮士

2476
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:55,120
大家快看我的丈夫 哇 你是什么颜色？

2477
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:58,920
- 黄色 亲爱的 - 你看上去真性感

2478
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,060
他来了

2479
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:03,120
天啊 你们知不知道韩大夫 是一辆有名的赛车？

2480
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:09,140
- 韩大夫？我们的韩大夫？ - 不是哈德逊大黄蜂吧？

2481
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:11,800
不 那是真的  他是真正的赛车史上的传奇人物

2482
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,140
他是最棒的哈德逊大黄蜂

2483
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:17,510
最棒的？我从没见过他时速超过20英里

2484
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,640
你真正见过他参加比赛吗？

2485
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,310
没有 但是我真希望我可以见到 他们说那真是棒极了

2486
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:27,260
- 他赢了三个活塞杯 - 他在他的杯里干了什么？

2487
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:29,660
我想这个年轻人一定是快热昏头了

2488
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:31,860
我想他已经热昏头了

2489
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:34,330
他的玻璃需要镀膜了

2490
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,160
- 你病了吗 伙计？ - 的确有点像

2491
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,000
他的玻璃需要镀膜了

2492
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:44,830
- 嘿 你干什么？ - 没关系 你相信我 对不对？

2493
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:47,610
我当然相信你 我担心的是他

2494
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:50,880
我相信他

2495
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:54,150
- 我们去兜兜风 - 兜风？

2496
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,520
没错 兜风

2497
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:58,720
像你这样大城市里的赛车 从来没有兜过风吗？

2498
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:01,490
呃...没有 从来没有

2499
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:27,820
你到底来不来？

2500
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,820
嗯

2501
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:38,350
- 你还以为他要逃跑 - 嘿 你相信吗？

2502
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,860
他以为韩大夫是一辆有名的赛车

2503
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,870
真是想的太多了

2504
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,370
我们出来了 我们要去那里？

2505
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,430
我也不知道

2506
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:57,300
哇 耶

2507
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,760
哦 哈哈

2508
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:19,500
啊

2509
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,490
哦

2510
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:49,490
这是什么地方？

2511
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,560
中转中心

2512
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:54,890
以前是公路旁最热闹的落脚点

2513
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:01,270
这个地方？

2514
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,940
是啊 真是很难想像

2515
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:11,340
想像呆在这里是什么感觉

2516
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:15,240
我好像不是很了解你

2517
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,550
一辆保时捷怎么会呆在这个地方？

2518
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:20,820
其实很简单 我从前

2519
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:25,060
我在洛杉矶是一个律师 生活节奏是那么的快

2520
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:28,690
是吗？你很富有吗？

2521
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:32,170
- 什么？ - 只是想知道答案

2522
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:35,570
是的 我的生活是这样的

2523
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,400
你知道吗？

2524
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:41,100
我从未感到开心过

2525
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:45,840
真的吗？

2526
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,650
最后我离开了加州

2527
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,020
一直开啊开 最后终于坏在了这里

2528
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,550
韩大夫把我修好 芙蓉收留了我

2529
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:57,620
他们都收留了我 我再也没有离开过

2530
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,590
我理解你

2531
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:03,500
需要放松一下 给你的电池充充电

2532
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:07,300
但是过了这么长时间 你为什么不回去

2533
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:11,730
我坠如了爱河

2534
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:15,470
- 哦 - 没错

2535
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:19,110
- 雪佛兰？ - 不是

2536
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,420
我爱上这里的景色了

2537
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,170
哇 快看啊

2538
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,370
他们只是驶过这里

2539
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,640
他们都不知道他们错过了什么

2540
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:51,980
以前并不是这样的

2541
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:54,780
是吗？

2542
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:58,760
没错 40年前 那条州际公路并不存在

2543
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:00,880
真的吗？

2544
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,660
是的 以前

2545
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:06,600
车在州之间穿行的方法 和现在是完全不同的

2546
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:09,200
你是什么意思？

2547
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:12,670
路并不像那条州际公路一样 直接穿过沙漠

2548
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:16,940
路是根据地形曲折蜿蜒的

2549
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,430
- 早上好  - 天气真不错

2550
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:25,150
车不是为了使自己高兴而驾驶

2551
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:27,780
他们是为了享受这个美好时光而驾驶

2552
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:04,190
然后发生了什么？

2553
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,710
为了节省10分钟的驾驶时间 公路饶过了我们这里

2554
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:37,470
能看到这城镇的昌盛时期该有多好

2555
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:40,350
我都不知梦想过多少次了

2556
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:44,080
终有一天我们会让它回到地图上

2557
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:47,820
是啊 嘿 谢谢你带我兜风

2558
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:49,720
我感到很高兴

2559
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:52,520
有时慢慢开感觉还不错

2560
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,330
不用谢

2561
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:03,970
听着

2562
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,140
如果有人问起我们 就说我们去撞信箱了

2563
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:09,300
什么？

2564
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:26,690
哦 漆还没有干呢

2565
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:39,170
不不不 离开我的店铺

2566
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,840
不要吃我的轮胎 吃这些旧的轮胎

2567
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:45,210
- 拖线 - 你可有麻烦了

2568
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,310
这些拖拉机是从哪里来的？

2569
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:50,890
- 嘿 伙计 - 嘿 嘿 伙计

2570
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,920
有一个向那边去了

2571
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:56,090
我去追他

2572
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,900
快过来 小拖拉机 快过来

2573
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,230
真是个乖拖拉机

2574
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,670
不不不不 过来这里

2575
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:07,100
你在干什么？

2576
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:09,870
你不应该在这里

2577
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:12,540
单独闲逛

2578
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:27,150
你想用这些老旧的赛车轮胎干什么？

2579
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:36,130
来吧 韩大夫 跑吧

2580
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:55,810
太棒了

2581
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,540
- 哇  - 嗯？

2582
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:59,210
你真是太棒了

2583
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:03,450
你要去哪？

2584
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,220
韩大夫 等一等

2585
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:11,530
往这边走 快点 生锈的家伙们

2586
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:17,630
韩大夫 你的技术真是太棒了

2587
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:21,000
- 太好了 现在请你离开 - 我是认真的 你还是和以前一样棒

2588
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,900
- 我叫你离开这里 - 得了吧

2589
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:25,970
我是一辆赛车 你是一辆老式的赛车

2590
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,030
但是在引擎盖下面 我们是一样的

2591
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:31,170
我们并不一样  明白了吗？现在离开这里

2592
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:34,180
一辆像你这样的车 为什么在你的尖峰时期退出？

2593
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:38,520
你以为我退出了？

2594
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,800
是啊

2595
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,070
54年的大撞车

2596
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:59,110
他们离开了我

2597
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:02,740
当我完全修好后 我回去以为别人会热烈欢迎我

2598
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:05,710
知道他们怎么说吗？ 你已经是历史了

2599
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:08,840
他们挑选了一位新人

2600
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:13,920
我还有很多能量可以发挥

2601
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:17,650
但是我却没有机会再表现了

2602
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:23,190
我把新闻留了下来

2603
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:27,530
来提醒我永远不要回头了

2604
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:29,800
我没有预料到会有人找到我

2605
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:33,500
- 韩大夫 我可不像他们 - 是吗？

2606
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:34,570
我不像他们

2607
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:38,480
你最后一次关心除了你自己 以外的人是什么时候？

2608
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:43,150
你说出一次来 我就回去参加比赛

2609
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:47,980
呃...我可不这样认为

2610
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:52,160
这里的人都是好人 每个人都关心对方

2611
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,930
我不想让他们依赖一个不值得依赖的人

2612
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,530
像你吗？ 你已经来这里多久了

2613
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,830
你的朋友们都不知道你真正的身份？

2614
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:03,560
到底是谁只会关心自己？

2615
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,440
快点修完那条路 然后离开这里

2616
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:23,290
你可不可以把那不尊重国旗音乐给关了

2617
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,800
尊重古典音乐

2618
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:38,340
啊

2619
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,620
他完成了

2620
01:20:53,690 --> 01:20:56,920
他一定是在我们睡觉时完成的

2621
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:59,220
太好了

2622
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,540
他走了？

2623
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:11,630
我们可不想让他错过那个比赛

2624
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:21,420
- 伙计 你是在哭吗？ - 不 我是太高兴了

2625
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:24,450
我不用每天再看着他了

2626
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:25,720
他走了我很高兴

2627
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:34,130
小红 怎么了？

2628
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,600
因为你走了 他感到很难过

2629
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:40,600
你去参加你的比赛

2630
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:43,540
去赢取你梦寐以求的活塞杯

2631
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:49,140
得到有钱的赞助商的赞助 还有直升机接送

2632
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:56,080
等一下

2633
01:21:57,490 --> 01:22:00,320
我知道你不会不说再见就离开的

2634
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:03,120
你还呆在这里干什么？ 你会错过你的比赛的

2635
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:06,860
没关系 我用警车护送你 把失去的时间赢回来

2636
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:08,090
谢谢 警长

2637
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:10,290
但是我现在还不能走

2638
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:11,860
为什么？

2639
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:14,770
我想我的轮胎

2640
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,740
- 没法熬到加州 - 换胎吗？

2641
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:21,070
你们谁知道路易奇的店什么时候开门？

2642
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:24,310
我真是不敢相信 四个全新的轮胎

2643
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,110
谢谢你 “闪电”麦坤

2644
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:31,280
- 你看看  - 这几年来我的第一位顾客

2645
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,950
我满含激动的泪水

2646
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:38,890
这是我生命中最快乐的一天

2647
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,960
好了 路易奇 把你最好的黑轮胎给我

2648
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:44,400
不 不不不

2649
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:47,840
你不知道你想要什么 路易奇知道你想要什么

2650
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:53,340
黑轮胎 太寻常了

2651
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:54,880
但是这个

2652
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:57,010
白色的轮胎

2653
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:02,250
好像是在说 快看我  我在这 爱上我

2654
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,120
好吧 你是专家

2655
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:07,120
别忘了备用胎

2656
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:10,020
- 太棒了 奇诺 - 开工

2657
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:24,340
我是怎么跟你说的 嗯？

2658
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:27,870
你说的对极了 比法拉利还要漂亮 对吗？

2659
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:29,810
呃...不对

2660
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:37,280
这个有机汽油真是在棒了 我以前怎么没听说过

2661
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:39,350
这是一个阴谋

2662
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,890
那些公司和政府有交易

2663
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:45,190
他们告诉我们的都是谎话

2664
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,390
好的 给我来一桶

2665
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:03,910
哦 额

2666
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,380
啊 耶

2667
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:16,450
咔嚓

2668
01:24:17,330 --> 01:24:20,300
- 她来了  - 让路 伙计们 快

2669
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,090
自然一点

2670
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:23,500
嗨 莎莉

2671
01:24:23,570 --> 01:24:25,400
好了 到底怎么回事？

2672
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:27,630
女士们先生们

2673
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:31,640
请欢迎崭新的“闪电”麦坤

2674
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,270
你认为怎么样？

2675
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:36,540
油车水镇 这漆在我身上看起来不错

2676
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:38,410
我说

2677
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,680
咔嚓

2678
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:44,280
你一定很适合加州

2679
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:48,280
天啊 你帮助了城镇里的每一个人

2680
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,190
耶 除了一个人

2681
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:56,420
- 现在是不是天黑了？ - 什么？他说什么？

2682
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:59,530
我再说一次 现在是不是天黑了？

2683
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,800
我应该做什么？

2684
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,590
他们修好了霓虹灯

2685
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:41,000
- 低一些慢一些 - 好的 亲爱的

2686
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:48,650
就像这个城镇的昌盛时期 对吗？

2687
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:52,090
比我想像中的还要好 谢谢你

2688
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:20,950
我们要去兜风吗？

2689
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:23,350
谢谢你 亲爱的 我非常想去

2690
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,890
- 不不不  - 莉奇

2691
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:29,290
我还记的斯坦利第一次叫我和他去兜风

2692
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,230
你好 莎莉 我可以请你去兜风吗？

2693
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,660
- 当然可以 拖线 - 呃

2694
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:46,510
我一次一次说不 他又问了我一次 我还是说不去

2695
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:50,910
对于一个2缸的车来说 他真是太漂亮了

2696
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:54,380
最后我说 只能兜一会儿

2697
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:59,550
哦

2698
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:06,020
- 嘿  - 谢谢 脱线

2699
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:08,390
你们两个晚安

2700
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:16,130
斯坦利 我真希望你可以看到这个景象

2701
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:24,040
- 那是我想看到的吗？ - 我不知道 芙蓉

2702
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:29,780
我还不知道结果是什么 但是我会找出结果的

2703
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:32,450
不是那个

2704
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:32,590
顾客？

2705
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:34,920
顾客？

2706
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:37,650
大伙 顾客们来了 有很多顾客

2707
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:39,890
你们知道该怎么做了 就像我们排练的一样

2708
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:43,630
那是幽灵之光

2709
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:46,290
我们找到了麦坤 我们找到了麦坤

2710
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:48,640
麦坤看这边

2711
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:51,470
- 等一等 - 他们说你去戒毒所了

2712
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:53,670
- 他们说你被压力压跨了？ - 什么？

2713
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:56,470
- 麦坤用上了白色的轮胎 - 你的胎坏了吗？

2714
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:57,540
麦坤

2715
01:27:57,610 --> 01:27:59,780
- 麦坤是不是你的囚犯？ - 当然不是

2716
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:02,320
才不是呢 我们是最好的朋友

2717
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:05,580
我只是在他逃跑时负责捉住他

2718
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:07,250
莎莉 莎莉

2719
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,380
你还会参加活塞杯吗？

2720
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,190
- 麦坤？ - 莎莉

2721
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:13,660
看这边 闪一下

2722
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:18,220
你在这里 感谢上帝 你还活着

2723
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:21,670
- 麦大叔？ - 我真不敢相信你在这里

2724
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:25,610
你是新闻头条

2725
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,410
对不起我把你搞丢了 老板

2726
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,340
麦大叔 真不敢相信你在这儿

2727
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:33,010
这不是世界上最快的赛车吗？

2728
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:35,610
- 那是哈夫吗？ - 是的 哈夫就在后面

2729
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:40,160
- 秀一下闪电  - 退后 狗仔队

2730
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:43,490
- 老麦坤在哪里？ - 实际上这是我好的一面

2731
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:45,820
- 哈夫 哈夫  - 秀下下闪电

2732
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:47,750
- 哈夫？ - 我在这里

2733
01:28:47,830 --> 01:28:50,530
- 小子 我在这儿 - 你还好吗 伙计

2734
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,260
我的明星客户从地球上消失了

2735
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,530
- 你说我感觉如何？ - 我可以解释

2736
01:28:55,610 --> 01:29:00,010
我感觉好极了 你在各种媒体上 电视 广播 报纸

2737
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:03,140
这是用钱也买不到的暴光率  你还要我干什么

2738
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:05,680
那只是些客套话 因为你签了合约

2739
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:08,050
你在哪里？我在我个导航仪上找不到你

2740
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,640
我在一个叫油车水镇的地方

2741
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:13,920
- 你知道66号州际公路吗？它就在这里  - 很好 太棒了 孩子

2742
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:15,190
游戏结束了

2743
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:19,090
当整个世界都在找你的时候 迪纳哥没有人可以选择

2744
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:20,860
- 他们要选择谁？ - 路霸

2745
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:24,560
没错 看看电视上在播什么

2746
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,800
- 给我看看雷鸣  - 你要看雷鸣？

2747
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:30,500
要看雷鸣？咔嚓 咔嚓

2748
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:33,840
- 嘿 那是我的招牌动作  - 你现在要马上赶到那里

2749
01:29:33,850 --> 01:29:35,800
现在 马上离开油车水镇

2750
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,810
不然你永远不可能和迪纳哥合作了 知道吗？

2751
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,710
等一下 哈夫

2752
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,580
不行 等等 你去哪里？

2753
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:44,920

2813
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:15,450
额

2814
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:29,300
放大 准备切换16号摄影机

2815
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:31,700
那就是“闪电'麦坤

2816
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:34,900
失踪了一周 但又从一个 不知名的地方冒了出来

2817
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:37,370
一个叫油车水镇的地方

2818
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:40,500
换了白色轮胎和其它装饰

2819
01:35:41,650 --> 01:35:44,770
- 哦  - 咔嚓 咔嚓 咔嚓

2820
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,410
你去哪了 麦坤 我真是寂寞

2821
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:51,390
没有人和我说话 除了迪纳哥的人

2822
01:35:51,450 --> 01:35:54,450
当然还有那对双胞胎姐妹 记得吗 她们是你忠实的粉丝

2823
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:57,690
现在她们是我的粉丝了 你知道她们说什么吗

2824
01:36:04,530 --> 01:36:06,590
啊

2825
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:09,800
伙计们 我们开始比赛吧

2826
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,640
你可以做到的

2827
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:19,740
加油 “国王” 我们为你感到骄傲

2828
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:24,150
50圈了 冠军还保持领先地位

2829
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:27,450
麦坤要超车了 他要从内道超车

2830
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:31,790
哦 他阻止了他

2831
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:34,260
“路霸”今天可不是好欺负的

2832
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,060
他落后了很长一段距离

2833
01:36:36,130 --> 01:36:38,430
他现在要追赶上去

2834
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,900
麦坤失去控制 滑到草地上去了

2835
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:56,480
只剩我和那辆老爷车了

2836
01:36:56,550 --> 01:37:00,080
麦坤今天不在状态

2837
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:05,320
- 孩子 你还好吗？ - 我不知道 麦大叔

2838
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:06,790
我想我

2839
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:09,550
我大老远的来可不是看你被淘汰的

2840
01:37:09,550 --> 01:37:11,100
韩大夫？

2841
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:16,430
伙计们 你们都来了  真不敢相信

2842
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:20,540
我知道你需要一个车队主管 但我不知道你这么烂

2843
01:37:20,610 --> 01:37:22,510
你说你永远不会回来了

2844
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:26,170
好吧 我没有选择的余地 拖线没有和你说再见

2845
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:29,150
再见 好了 没我事了

2846
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:36,620
如果你能像你修路时那样驾驶

2847
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:39,960
就算你闭着眼也能赢这场比赛

2848
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:42,020
回到比赛去吧

2849
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:47,240
他终于恢复状态了  奇诺 路易奇

2850
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:49,600
你们如果要和专业的维修团队竞争

2851
01:37:49,670 --> 01:37:52,840
- 你们的动作必须要快 - 他们根本都不知道他们为什么输了

2852
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:54,600
孩子 你一定会赢他们的

2853
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:58,080
最好的队员和你合作 你会夺回那一圈的差距的

2854
01:38:09,790 --> 01:38:11,690
- 是他？ - 哦 没错 就是他

2855
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,530
是他吗？那是哈德逊大黄蜂  哈德逊大黄蜂回来了

2856
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,230
看上去麦坤有了自己的维修团队

2857
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,700
看看他们的主管是谁

2858
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:23,470
- 快看 是哈德逊大黄蜂  - 哇

2859
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:26,870
真是太棒了 当然是他

2860
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:33,540
这真是在制造历史

2861
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:36,520
50年来 有人见过这位赛车界的传奇人物

2862
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:37,990
嘿 韩大夫

2863
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:42,220
快看看这位在广播上的人 他看起来就像你

2864
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:50,930
- 麦坤在内道超车了 - 但是他还落后一圈

2865
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,900
还剩60圈 他能赶上他们吗？

2866
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:56,870
你做的很好 要保持下去

2867
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:58,530
加油 加油

2868
01:38:58,610 --> 01:39:01,510
嘿 麦坤在哪里找到你的？

2869
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:05,010
那些圆的东西叫轮胎 它们应该放在车子下面

2870
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:06,830
[意大利语]
你认为你在和谁说话？

2871
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:07,780
-  但是 你在和谁说话？ - 不

2872
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:09,280
你会有机会表现的

2873
01:39:09,290 --> 01:39:11,660
你会有机会表现的

2874
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:29,270
这小子想成为英雄吗？

2875
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,100
看看这个怎么样？

2876
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:34,340
对 就是这样 孩子

2877
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:38,940
什么？

2878
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:40,810
哇 就是这样

2879
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:46,850
- 是我教他的 咔嚓  - 啊

2880
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:49,890
麦坤真是太棒了 他已经追上领跑者了

2881
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,790
这才是最关键的

2882
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:55,020
3辆车的比赛 还剩下10圈

2883
01:39:58,670 --> 01:40:01,870
看看在跑的那小子

2884
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:09,880
啊

2885
01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:12,370
不 这可不行

2886
01:40:15,450 --> 01:40:17,440
韩大夫 我暴胎了 我暴胎了

2887
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,960
- 你能开到维修站吗？ - 我想没问题

2888
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:24,320
亮黄旗了 快开进来 不要失去信心

2889
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:28,390
我们必须马上把他修好

2890
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:31,400
不然我们不可能赢这场比赛

2891
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:33,630
奇诺 时间到了

2892
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:41,000
小不点 你要帮他擦挡风玻璃吗？

2893
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:51,550
真是不敢相信

2894
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:53,320
那是我见过的最快的换胎过程

2895
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:55,950
漂亮的停站 但是他必须超过那辆安全车

2896
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:57,720
接近了

2897
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,860
太棒了 伙计

2898
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,300
他又回来了

2899
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:05,620
换胎完毕

2900
01:41:07,070 --> 01:41:09,000
- 奇诺 你成功了  - 干得好 奇诺

2901
01:41:24,290 --> 01:41:27,350
我们即将进入最后一圈

2902
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:29,790
麦坤就跟在他们后边 多棒的回归

2903
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:33,390
199圈了 已经到了最关键的时刻

2904
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:34,730
就是这样 孩子

2905
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,290
就剩下4个弯脚了 一个一个的来

2906
01:41:37,370 --> 01:41:39,800
加速猛冲 希望你不会失控

2907
01:41:39,870 --> 01:41:41,270
冲啊

2908
01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:45,100
瞧瞧这个

2909
01:41:46,610 --> 01:41:48,170
麦坤在内道超车

2910
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:54,170
- “国王”和“路霸”失控了 - 麦坤滑出了赛道

2911
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:07,330
- 麦坤又回来了  - 他回到了赛道

2912
01:42:07,730 --> 01:42:10,390
- 壮如凯迪拉克 - 快如宝马

2913
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:15,100
咔嚓 咔嚓 咔...

2914
01:42:16,670 --> 01:42:19,670
“闪电”麦坤即将赢得活塞杯了

2915
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:21,840
你一定会赢的 一定会

2916
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:27,150
我不会再跟在你屁股后面开了 老家伙

2917
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:39,390
哦 不

2918
01:42:57,910 --> 01:43:00,110

我赢了 宝贝 耶 哦耶

2920
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:07,350
他到底想干什么 韩大夫？

2921
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:19,100
你要干什么 孩子？

2922
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:22,400
我想“国王”应该完成 他的最后一场比赛

2923
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:28,570
你刚刚放弃了活塞杯 你知道吗？

2924
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:32,240
有一辆老赛车教会了我一些事

2925
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,370
那只是一个没用的杯子

2926
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:39,050
在最后一圈推车符合赛规吗？

2927
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:42,790
他没有在推 他只是跟在他后边开而已

2928
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:45,160

但是我没有赢

2956
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:46,440
“闪电” 除了赢得比赛之外 还有其它更重要的事

2957
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:49,210
你看他都生锈了 他需要“锈不来”保险杠防锈药膏

2958
01:45:49,290 --> 01:45:53,450
围着车绕圈子

2959

感谢你 泰克思先生 但是

01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:59,060

2962
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:05,460
我尊重你的决定

2963
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:06,700

01:46:10,710 --> 01:46:13,230
我很感激 谢谢你

2966
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:17,700

2971
01:46:35,730 --> 01:46:38,030
我们是不是该重新装修一下了

奇诺 这是真正的舒马赫的法拉利

2976
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,580
一辆真正的法拉利

2977
01:46:57,650 --> 01:46:59,780
在我脸上打一拳 奇诺 打一拳

2978
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:03,310

01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,780
其实我想在这里呆一段时间

2983
01:47:30,850 --> 01:47:34,120
- 我听说这个地方又在地图上出现了 - 是吗？

2984
01:47:34,190 --> 01:47:37,960
有人说一个活塞杯获得者

2985
01:47:38,030 --> 01:47:40,500
会在这里建立他的比赛中心

2986
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:43,400
真的吗？这对小镇来说是件大好事

2987
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:45,960
我很想你 莎莉

2988
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:50,170
我有一种别人并不理解的感觉

2989
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:52,400
等等等

2990
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:55,800
麦坤和莎莉停在树旁边

2997
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:17,860
