    We hear audience laughter.

              Give it up for my man, Mr. Kumail
              Nanjiani!

                           KUMAIL (V.O.)
              Hello. I grew up in Pakistan. And people
              are always asking me, what was that like?
              Really not that different from here. I
              mean we played cricket, which is just a
              spicier version of baseball. And we
              prayed a lot. Well not a lot, just five
              times a day. And we marry someone our
              parents find for us. Arranged marriage,
              you know. For me, it was probably that we
              got episodes of the A-Team a little bit
              later. And by a little bit later, I mean
              we just got episode two. But other than
              that, it was exactly the same.

    Kumail drives an Uber around Chicago with VARIOUS
    PASSENGERS in the backseat.



    INT. TRIPLE DOOR - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT

    Kumail walks into the comedy club as MARY is doing a set
    on stage. CHRIS intercepts Kumail as he walks backstage.

                           CHRIS
              There's no bad crowds dude. Only bad
              comedians.

                           KUMAIL
              You complain about the crowd like all
              the time.

                           CHRIS
              Yeah, but that's when they're really bad.

                           KUMAIL
              So like ninety percent of the time,
              they're really bad?

                           CHRIS
              Will you just watch and give me notes
              tonight? If we both give each other
              notes, I think it would be helpful.

                           KUMAIL
              Your notes are just to add more "fucks"
              into the bit.

                           CHRIS
              Fuck's a funny word. Soft on the top and
              it's hard on the end.

    Mary walks off the stage and sits on the couch next to
    CJ.

                           MARY
              That was truly horrible.

                           KUMAIL
              Hey, that was great.

                           MARY
              No, he didn't even crack a smile. I
              thought I was gonna puke.

                             CHRIS
              Who?

                             MARY
              Bob Dalavan.

                           CHRIS
              Who's Bob Dalaban?

                           CJ
              Bob Dalavan - works for the Montreal
              Comedy Festival, you fuckin' doof.
              Don't you want to get noticed? Move to
              LA? Hang out with Elijah Wood and shit.

    ANDY DODD, the coked-up emcee, appears out of the
    bathroom.

                           DODD
              No one's on stage?

                             MARY
              No!

    Dodd rushes on stage.

                           KUMAIL
              He might have been doing cocaine.
3


                           CJ
              Was he doing cocaine recreationally?

                           MARY
              A true cokehead.

    Dodd jumps up on stage.

                           DODD (O.S.)
              Now before I bring up the next guy, you
              guys know tonight is Jell-o Shot
              Tuesday! Whooo!! And we all know what
              happens after eight Jell-o shots. We
              urinate all over ourselves and puke.
              Okay, so I'm going to bring up the next
              comic. You know this man.

    Chris slaps his own face.

                           CHRIS
              Confidence. Poise. Smile.

                           Dodd (O.S.)
              Give it up for Mister Chris Jones!


    Chris walks on stage.

                           KUMAIL
              He's like if a serial killer fucked an
              inspirational speaker.

                           CJ
              He's like Daniel Day Lewis except he
              sucks.

                           CHRIS
              Just bought a laser printer. Printed
              out like six lasers so far.

    CJ, Kumail, and Mary watching Chris' set. Andy Dodd
    saunters backstage.

                           KUMAIL
              Hey Dodd. Dalavan's in the crowd
              tonight. Could I do ten?

                           DODD
              No. Five minutes. You put out chairs,
              you get five minutes. You know the
              deal.

                           KUMAIL
              C'mon man. I'll double it up next time.

                            DODD
              No.

    Dodd walks back into the bathroom.

                           KUMAIL
              What are you gonna do in there?

                           DODD
              I'm making up next week's schedule.

                            KUMAIL
              Okay. Cool.



    INT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATER

    CJ is on stage crushing it. Kumail and Mary watch from
    the wings.

                           CJ
              I was in bed with my girlfriend and I was
              trying to mansplain to her that, you
              know, we are on one little rock orbiting
              a star in a galaxy of a billion stars in
              a universe full of a billion galaxies, so
              I forgot your birthday. Who gives a shit?
              You are cosmically over reacting to this.
              Honestly you are being super selfish.
              You're right, but you're selfish.

    Kumail looks out at the crowd. Dalavan enjoys CJ's set.



    INT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATER

    Kumail puts a RECORDER on his stool, presses RECORD and
    starts his set.

                           KUMAIL
              Hey! Have you guys heard of this new drug
              cocktail called cheese? I saw these news
              reports so I looked up what cheese is and
              cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM
              and heroin. So really, it's heroin.
              Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do
              the heroin, it's very powerful. You
              already have heroin.

    Kumail looks to see if Bob Dalavan is laughing. He's not
    there. He's in the back talking to CJ. Fuck.

                          KUMAIL (CONT'D)
                   (pushing through)
             Is Pakistan in the house?!

    O.S. A WOMAN "Woo-hoos!" Kumail looks out at the crowd
    and sees EMILY, late 20's, white with a streak of blue
    in her hair. She sits at a table with a few friends.

                          KUMAIL (CONT'D)
             You're not from Pakistan. I would have
             noticed you.

    She smiles.

    Crowded bar scene after the show. Kumail, Chris, Mary
    and CJ hang out at the bar.

                          CHRIS
             He just gave you Montreal? Like you
             don't have to showcase or audition or
             anything?

                          CJ
             It was too easy. Like I wanted to
             struggle. I wanted a story to be able
             to tell on talk shows and instead,
             like, you guys don't know how hard it
             is not to struggle. It's a struggle
             succeeding effortlessly.

                          MARY
             Did he say anything about me?

                          CJ
             Sure.

                          CHRIS
             What about me?

                          CJ
             Both of you. He said, those guys
             performed...

                          MARY
             I truly hate you, actually.

                          CHRIS
             We all hate you.

    Kumail walks over to Emily and her friend JESSIE, talks
    loud over the music.

                          KUMAIL
             Hi.
6


                          EMILY
              Hi.

                           KUMAIL
              Um, my name is Kumail.

                           EMILY
              Yeah. We know.

                           JESSIE
              We saw you perform.

                           KUMAIL
              Yeah. Now that the niceties are out of
              the way, I have to tell you that when
              you yelled at me, it threw me off. You
              really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's
              so rude.

                           EMILY
              I didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed
              you. It was supportive.

                           KUMAIL
              Okay, that's a common misconception.
              Yelling anything at a comedian is
              considered heckling. Heckling doesn't
              have to be negative.

                           EMILY
              So if I yelled out "You're amazing in
              bed," that would be a heckle?

                           KUMAIL
              Yeah. It'd be an accurate heckle.

                           JESSIE
              Wow. Goodbye!

    Jessie walks away.

                           EMILY
              Don't go! You scared my friend off now.

                           KUMAIL
              What's your name?

                          EMILY
              Emily.

    Kumail writes Emily's name in Urdu on a napkin.
7


                           KUMAIL
              I want to show you something, Emily.
              This is your name in Urdu.

    Emily picks up the napkin, looks at it.

                           EMILY
              Whoa. Does this move work?

                           KUMAIL
              I've had some minor success with it.

                           EMILY
              Bullshit.



    INT. TRIPLE DOOR BAR - LATER

    Emily and Kumail are still at the bar.

                           KUMAIL
              So you came to a comedy show with your
              friends?

                           EMILY
              Yeah, we're all grad students at U of
              C.

                           KUMAIL
              What are you studying at grad school?

                           EMILY
              I study psychology. I'm going to be a
              therapist.

                           KUMAIL
              Oh so you're gonna sit on a couch and
              ask people, "how did that make you
              feel?"

                           EMILY
              Eventually. Right now I'm doing field
              work with a group of guys convicted of
              domestic violence.

                           KUMAIL
              Jesus.

                           EMILY
              Cheers to that.
8


                           KUMAIL
              Oh wow. No, don't cheers to that. To
              you becoming a therapist.

                           EMILY
              Great. To me getting my masters. We'll
              start there and then we'll go to the
              rest of it.



    INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - LATER

    Kumail and Emily walk in. It's a typical bachelor pad
    boy house. Milk crates for furniture, mess everywhere,
    no art on the walls. Chris is sitting on the couch
    watching TV.

                           KUMAIL
              So my roommate Chris is probably on the
              couch. He's going to try and start a
              conversation. So no matter what- do not
              engage. Okay? Let's go.

                           CHRIS
              Hi!

    Emily and Kumail walk by Chris avoiding eye contact.
    Kumail closes the bedroom door behind him.

                           CHRIS (CONT'D)
              Good for him.



    INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM- CONTINUOUS

    Kumail's bed is an inflatable air mattress. There are
    clothes everywhere.

                           KUMAIL
              Do you want to watch a movie?

                           EMILY
              Sure. Should I just, put my stuff down?
              Or...

                           KUMAIL
              Yeah, I would say it's safe. You know
              what, go for that area. I cleaned that
              earlier this year.

    Kumail points to a corner of his room covered in dirty
    clothes.

                           EMILY
              Should I take my shoes off or is this a
              shoes on bed?

                           KUMAIL
              No, it's a shoes off bed. I have strict
              rules.

    Emily crawls onto the air mattress.

                           EMILY
              Oh wow. That's totally an inflated
              mattress.

                           KUMAIL
              Yeah. Did you think it would be a flat
              inflatable mattress?

                           EMILY
              I did think it might be an actual
              mattress.

                           KUMAIL
              Well air mattresses are actual
              mattresses. You're being bigoted towards
              air based comfort items.

    Kumail picks up the remote and turns on the TV. Night of
    the Living Dead is playing.

                           KUMAIL (CONT'D)
              Night of The Living Dead?

                           EMILY
              Sure, I haven't ever seen that movie.

                           KUMAIL
              Okay, so basically the dead start rising.
              And the good guys, um...

    They eye each other flirtatiously. Laugh. Lean in and
    kiss.



    INT. KUMAIL'S LIVING ROOM

    Chris hits the Siri button on his iPhone.

                           CHRIS
              Text Lauren. You up girl?

                           SIRI
              What do you want to say to Warren?

                            CHRIS
               Ah, no. Fuck.

     Chris hits the Siri button again.

                            SIRI
               What do you want to say to-

                            CHRIS
               You up? Period. Send.

                            SIRI
               That may be beyond my abilities at the
               moment.

                            CHRIS
               Fuck.



     INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Kumail and Emily post-coital.

                            EMILY
               What are these scars?

                            KUMAIL
               Oh, they're a smallpox vaccination.

                            EMILY
               I thought only old people had those.

                            KUMAIL
               Well I'm from Pakistan. We're still
               fighting some battles you guys have
               already won.

                            EMILY
               What were you like in high school? Were
               you like, super funny? Were you really
               smart?

                            KUMAIL
               I was very shy. They called me
               chashmullee.

                            EMILY
               What is that?

                            KUMAIL
               It roughly translates to "dweeb." I'll
               show you a picture.
11


     Kumail flips through his phone and produces his old high
     school photo, shows it to her.

                           EMILY
              Of you in high school? Oh my god!

                             KUMAIL
              Boom.

                             EMILY
              No.

                           KUMAIL
              And I'm thinking I'm killing it right
              now.

                           EMILY
              What inspired this hair cut?

                             KUMAIL
              Hugh Grant.

                           EMILY
              Oh no. And you're so serious.

                           KUMAIL
              I read in an interview with Hugh Grant,
              he said he doesn't smile because it
              makes his face look fat. So I didn't
              smile in pictures for many years. What
              were you like in high school? Were you
              voted... Most Sexy?

                           EMILY
              No. I was voted "Most Noticeable."

                             KUMAIL
              That's good.

                           EMILY
              No. It's really not good. I had acne,
              and I was a Goth and I had this
              terrible perm. The kids called me
              Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually
              I do know why, it's because they
              thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I
              think I'm done with this subject. In
              fact, I think I'm gonna go home.

     Emily gets up, pulling the blanket with her to hide her
     body. Kumail holds onto it, stopping her progress.

                           KUMAIL
              Wait we haven't even had sex again yet.
12


     She tugs the blanket, he lets go. She dresses behind it.

                            EMILY
               No. No. I'm really not that kind of
               girl. I only have sex once on a first
               date. Plus a hand job.

                            KUMAIL
               Well I haven't had that yet!

     Emily laughs.

                            EMILY
               You don't get that because you made fun
               of me.

                            KUMAIL
               What is happening right now? What are you
               doing?

                            EMILY
               I'm changing under this blanket.

                            KUMAIL
               I've seen everything. Do you remember, we
               were just having sex?

                            EMILY
               Yeah, but you were in the throes of
               passion then. Listen, I had a really nice
               time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna
               call an Uber and go home.

     Emily pulls out her PHONE, calls an Uber. Kumail's phone
     makes a noise. They exchange a look.

                            KUMAIL
               Your driver will be ready as soon as he
               puts on his pants.

                            EMILY
               Were you available for rides while we
               were fucking?

                            KUMAIL
               Yeah, but I only looked a couple of
               times.



     INT. KUMAIL'S CAR - LATER

     Kumail Ubers Emily home. Emily sits in the back.
13


                  KUMAIL
     So. Maybe I'll run into you at the club
     sometime and we can grab a drink?

                  EMILY
     I'm not really - I know this sounds
     like a line - but I'm not really dating
     right now. I have a lot of school and
     work and just a lot on my plate.

                  KUMAIL
     That's perfect because I'm not really
     dating right now either. I actually
     have a pretty strict two-day rule where
     I can't see someone more than two days
     in a row. So since we hung out for two
     days, if I were to see you again, which
     I won't because you're not dating, I'm
     not dating, I wouldn't be able to see
     you until Monday.

                  EMILY
     We haven't hung out for two days. We've
     hung out for about five hours. Just to
     like, be totally clear.

                  KUMAIL
     Yesterday and today. Cause it's after
     midnight, today is actually tomorrow.
     Earlier tonight was yesterday. So two
     days.

                  EMILY
     You see, I don't date time nerds, so that
     really takes you off the table.

                  KUMAIL
     That works out, because I am a hard
     core time nerd.

                  EMILY
     Yeah, I can tell.

                  KUMAIL
     I'm like, very strict about AM/PM
     stuff.

                  EMILY
     So wait, just to establish, what did we
     just decide?

                  KUMAIL
     We decided we aren't ever going to see
     each other again.
14


                            EMILY
               Great. I'm glad we're on the same page.



     INT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS DINING ROOM - BRUNCH

     Kumail is eating brunch with his father, AZMAT, his
     mother SHARMEEN, his brother, NAVEED, and his sister-in-
     law, FATIMA.

                            Azmat
               Look at these jeans, Kumi. They're from
               Citizens of Humanity, that's the
               brand's name. Touch them. They're so
               soft.

                            KUMAIL
               I don't want to touch your jeans.

                            AZMAT
               They're like sweatpants. You should be
               stylish like your father. It's not very
               difficult. Just observe me.

                            NAVEED
               Get some Daddy Style.

                            SHARMEEN
               Kumi, why don't you grow a beard? Not
               like Naveed's, just a small one.

                            AZMAT
               Maybe like mine, small and stylish.

                            SHARMEEN
               Kumi, I've been thinking, you know, why
               you don't enroll for LSAT now?

                            KUMAIL
               Yeah sorry, Ma. I haven't done it yet.
               I like that you bring it up as though
               you've never brought it up before.

                            NAVEED
               How's the stand-up coming Bhai?

                            KUMAIL
               It's going fine.

                            SHARMEEN
               Since when are you someone to stand-up?
               You know who I think should stand up is
               Malala. She has something to say.
