      EXT. MARIGOLD PATH - DUSK

      A path of marigold petals leads up to an altar lovingly
      arranged in a humble cemetery. An old woman lights a candle
      as the smoke of burning copal wood dances lyrically upward...

      The smoke lifts up toward lines of papel picado �- cut paper
      banners -- that sway gently in the breeze.

      PAPEL PICADO CARD: "COCO"

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Sometimes I think I'm cursed...
                  'cause of something that happened
                  before I was even born.

      A story begins to play out on the papel picado.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  See, a long time ago there was this
                  family.

      The images on the papel picado come to life to illustrate a
      father, a mother, and a little girl. The family is happy.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  The pap�, he was a musician.

      The pap� plays guitar while the mother dances with her
      daughter.

                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  He and his family would sing, and
                  dance, and count their blessings...
                      (beat)
                  But he also had a dream... to play
                  for the world.
                      (beat)
                  And one day he left with his
                  guitar... and never returned.

      The man walks down a road, guitar slung on his back. In
      another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway, watching
      her pap� leave. Two feet step up next to her. It is her
      mam�, hardened.

      She shuts the door.





                                                                     2.


                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  And the mam�...? She didn't have
                  time to cry over that walkaway
                  musician!
                      (beat)
                  After banishing all music from her
                  life...

      The woman gets rid of all of her husband's instruments and
      records.

                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  She found a way to provide for her
                  daughter...
                      (beat)
                  She rolled up her sleeves and she
                  learned to make shoes.
                      (beat)
                  She could have made candy!

      Amongst the papel picado, a stick swings at a strung up
      pi�ata which bursts with candy...

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Or fireworks!

      Fireworks go off in the background...

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers!

      Sparkly underwear and a luchador mask hang on a line amongst
      other linens...

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  But no... she chose shoes...

      On the papel picado, the little girl becomes a young woman.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Then she taught her daughter to
                  make shoes. And later, she taught
                  her son-in-law.

      She introduces a suitor to the family business.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Then her grandkids got roped in.
                  As her family grew, so did the
                  business.

      In the next vignette, a bunch of goofy grandchildren join in
      the shoemaking. The shoe shop is full of family!




                                                                     3.


                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Music had torn her family apart,
                  but shoes held them all together.
                      (beat)
                  You see, that woman was my great-
                  great grandmother, Mam� Imelda.

      TILT DOWN from the papel picado to the


      OFRENDA ROOM - DAY

      where a photo sits at the top of a beautiful altar. The
      photo features MAM� IMELDA -- serious, formidable. She holds
      a baby on her lap. Her husband stands beside her, but his
      face has been torn away.

                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  She died WAY before I was born.
                  But my family still tells her story
                  every year on D�a de los Muertos --
                  the Day of the Dead...
                      (beat)
                  And her little girl?

      Fade from the face of the little girl to present day MAM�
      COCO (97), a living raisin, convalescing in a wicker
      wheelchair.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  She's my great grandmother, Mam�
                  Coco.

      A boy (12) walks into frame and kisses her on the cheek.
      This is our narrator, MIGUEL.

                            MIGUEL
                  Hol�, Mam� Coco.

                            MAM� COCO
                  How are you, Julio?

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Actually, my name is Miguel. Mam�
                  Coco has trouble remembering
                  things... But it's good to talk to
                  her anyway. So I tell her pretty
                  much everything.

      QUICK CUTS of Miguel with Mam� Coco:





                                                                         4.


      EXT. COURTYARD

                            MIGUEL
                  I used to run like this...

      Miguel pumps his arms with his hands in fists.           Then he
      switches to flat palms.

                            MIGUEL
                  But now I run like this which is
                  way faster!

                                                       CUT TO:


      INT. MAM� COCO'S ROOM

      Miguel, in a luchador mask, climbs onto the bed, arms raised.

                            MIGUEL
                  And the winner is... Luchadora
                  Coco!

      Miguel leaps off the bed onto a pile of pillows that bursts,
      sending feathers onto Mam� Coco who wears a mask of her own.

                                                       CUT TO:


      EXT. DINING AREA

      Miguel leans toward Mam� Coco at the dinner table.

                            MIGUEL
                  I have a dimple on this side, but
                  not on this side. Dimple. No
                  dimple. Dimple. No dimple--

                             ABUELITA
                  Miguel!   Eat your food.

      Miguel's ABUELITA (70s) runs the table like a ship captain.
      She gives Mam� Coco a kiss on the head.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  My Abuelita? She's Mam� Coco's
                  daughter.

      Abuelita piles extra tamales on Miguel's plate.

                            ABUELITA
                  Aw, you're a twig, mijo.         Have some
                  more.




                                                                       5.


                            MIGUEL
                  No, gracias.

                            ABUELITA
                  I asked if you would like more
                  tamales.

                               MIGUEL
                  S-s�?

                            ABUELITA
                  That's what I THOUGHT you said.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Abuelita runs our house just like
                  Mam� Imelda did.

      INT. OFRENDA ROOM - DAY

      Abuelita adjusts the photo of her beloved Mam� Imelda. Then
      she perks her ear at a hooting sound.


      INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

      Miguel idly blows into a glass soda bottle.     Abuelita takes
      the bottle away.

                               ABUELITA
                  No music!


      INT. MAM� COCO'S ROOM - DAY

      Miguel listens as a truck drives by the window, blaring radio
      tunes. Abuelita angrily slams the window shut.

                               ABUELITA
                  No music!!


      EXT. STREET - EVENING

      A trio of gentlemen serenade each other as they stroll by the
      family compound.

                            MUSICIANS
                      (singing)
                  AUNQUE LA VIDA--





                                                                      6.


      Abuelita bursts out of the gate and chases them away.

                            ABUELITA
                  NO MUSIC!!!

      Terrified, the musicians stumble as they run away.

                            MIGUEL (V.O)
                  I think we're the only family in
                  M�xico who hates music...


      INT. RIVERA WORKSHOP - DAY

      We see the Rivera family tinkering in the shoe shop, no music
      to be heard. Miguel jogs past them.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  And my family's fine with that...

      He grabs his shine box, and heads out of the shoe shop.

                              MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  But me?

                            MAM�
                  Be back by lunch, mijo!

                            MIGUEL
                  Love you, Mam�!

      Once outside, Miguel makes his way through the small town of


      SANTA CECILIA - MORNING

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  I am NOT like the rest of my
                  family...

      He passes a woman sweeping a stoop.

                            WOMAN
                  Hola, Miguel!

                              MIGUEL
                  Hola!

      He passes a band of musicians playing a tune. Miguel joins
      with some air guitar and the further down the street he goes,
      the more instruments and sounds layer in. The bells of the
      church chime in harmony, a radio blares a cumbia rhythm.





                                                                      7.


      Running past a food stand, Miguel grabs a roll of pan dulce
      and tosses the vendor a coin.

                            MIGUEL
                  Muchas gracias!

                            STREET VENDOR
                  De nada, Miguel!

      As Miguel passes all these scenes, the music synthesizes and
      he can't help but tap out rhythms along a table of alebrijes.
      The fantastical wooden animal sculptures each play a
      different tone like a marimba. Miguel finishes with a SMACK
      on a trash can, out of which a pops up a scrappy hairless
      Xolo dog. The dog, DANTE, barks and jumps up to lick Miguel,
      who laughs.

                              MIGUEL
                  Hey, hey!    Dante!

      Miguel holds the pan dulce over Dante's head.

                             MIGUEL
                  Sit. Down. Roll over.        Shake.
                  Fist bump.

      Dante obeys to the best of his ability.

                            MIGUEL
                  Good boy, Dante!

      Miguel tosses the pan dulce to his furless friend who topples
      back into the trash can.

                                                    CUT TO:


      MARIACHI PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER

      Miguel rounds the corner toward the town square. Vendors
      sell sugar skulls and marigolds, and musicians fill the
      square with music.

                             MIGUEL (V.O)
                  I know I'm not supposed to love
                  music -- but it's not my fault!
                      (beat)
                  It's his: Ernesto de la Cruz...

      Miguel approaches a statue of a handsome mariachi at the
      heart of the plaza.





                                                                      8.


                            MIGUEL (V.O)
                  ...The greatest musician of all
                  time.

      A tour group and their TOUR GUIDE are gathered around the
      base of the statue.

                            TOUR GUIDE
                  And right here, in this very plaza,
                  the young Ernesto de la Cruz took
                  his first steps toward becoming the
                  most beloved singer in Mexican
                  history!

                                                   CUT TO:

      CLIPS of de la Cruz in his hay day: playing as a young man in
      the plaza, serenading bystanders in a train car...

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  He started out a total nobody from
                  Santa Cecilia, like me. But when
                  he played music, he made people
                  fall in love with him.

      MORE CLIPS from de la Cruz's films. He leaps from a tree
      branch onto a galloping horse. He plays his signature skull
      guitar with flourish and flair.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  He starred in movies. He had the
                  coolest guitar... He could fly!

      A CLIP features de la Cruz dressed as a hovering priest, held
      up by strings, in front of a cycling sky flat.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  And he wrote the best songs! But
                  my all-time favorite? It's--

      A CLIP of de la Cruz performing in a fancy nightclub.

                            DE LA CRUZ
                      (singing)
                  REMEMBER ME
                  THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE
                  REMEMBER ME
                  DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY
                  FOR EVEN IF I'M FAR AWAY
                  I HOLD YOU IN MY HEART
                  I SING A SECRET SONG TO YOU
                  EACH NIGHT WE ARE APART
                  REMEMBER ME
                            (MORE)


                                                                     9.

                            DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D)
                  THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR
                  REMEMBER ME
                  EACH TIME YOU HEAR A SAD GUITAR
                  KNOW THAT I'M WITH YOU THE ONLY WAY
                  THAT I CAN BE...

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  He lived the kind of life you dream
                  about... Until 1942...

      As the audience swoons over de la Cruz, an absent-minded
      stagehand leans on a lever. Ropes and pulleys go flying.

                            DE LA CRUZ
                  UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN
                  REMEMBER ME!

      De la Cruz is subsequently crushed by a giant bell.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  When he was crushed by a giant
                  bell.

      MARIACHI PLAZA - DAY

      Miguel gazes up at the statue of de la Cruz in awe.

                            MIGUEL (V.O)
                  I wanna be just like him.

                                                   CUT TO:


      EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

      Miguel weaves up to de la Cruz's mausoleum and peeks in the
      window. He catches a glimpse of de la Cruz's signature skull
      guitar.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and
                  I get this feeling... like we're
                  connected somehow. Like, if HE
                  could play music, maybe someday I
                  could too...





                                                                       10.


      EXT. MARIACHI PLAZA - DAY

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  ...If it wasn't for my family.

                            PLAZA MARIACHI
                      (playful)
                  Ay, ay, ay, muchacho.

                              MIGUEL
                  Huh?

                            PLAZA MARIACHI
                  I asked for a shoe shine, not your
                  life story.

      Miguel comes out of his reverie and looks up at the PLAZA
      MARIACHI whose shoes he is shining.

                            MIGUEL
                  Oh, yeah, sorry.

      He goes back to scrubbing the man's shoe.    As Miguel shines,
      the mariachi plucks his guitar idly.

                            MIGUEL
                  I just can't really talk about any
                  of this at home so...

                            PLAZA MARIACHI
                  Look, if I were you I'd march right
                  up to my family and say, "Hey! I'm
                  a musician. Deal with it!"

                            MIGUEL
                  I could never say that...

                            PLAZA MARIACHI
                  You ARE a musician, no?

                            MIGUEL
                  I don't know. I mean... I only
                  really play for myself--

                            PLAZA MARIACHI
                  Did de la Cruz become the world's
                  best musician by hiding his sweet,
                  sweet skills? No! He walked out
                  onto that plaza and he played out
                  loud!





                                                                     11.


      The mariachi gets an idea. He points to the gazebo where
      organizers are setting up for a show. They unfurl a canvas
      poster which reads "TALENT SHOW."

                            PLAZA MARIACHI (CONT'D)
                  Ah, mira, mira! They're setting up
                  for tonight. The music competition
                  for D�a de Muertos. You wanna be
                  like your hero? You should sign
                  up!

                            MIGUEL
                  Uh-uh, my family would freak!

                            PLAZA MARIACHI
                  Look, if you're too scared, then,
                  well... have fun making shoes.

      Miguel considers this.

                              PLAZA MARIACHI (CONT'D)
                  C'mon.    What did de la Cruz always
                  say?

                            MIGUEL
                  ...Seize your moment?

      The mariachi appraises Miguel, then offers his guitar.

                            PLAZA MARIACHI
                  Show me what you got, muchacho.
                  I'll be your first audience.

      Miguel's brows rise, surprised. He reaches to take the
      instrument, regarding it as if holding a holy relic.

      Miguel spreads his fingers across the strings anticipating
      his chord and...

                              ABUELITA (O.S.)
                  MIGUEL!

      Startled, Miguel impulsively throws the guitar back onto the
      mariachi's lap. He turns to see Abuelita marching toward
      him. Miguel's T�O BERTO (40s) and PRIMA ROSA (16), follow
      with supplies from the market.

                              MIGUEL
                  Abuelita!

                            ABUELITA
                  What are you doing here?





                                                                      12.


                               MIGUEL
                  Um...uh...

      Miguel quickly packs away his shine rag and polishes.
      Abuelita barrels up to the mariachi.

      She hits his hat with her shoe and waves him away.

                            ABUELITA
                  You leave my grandson alone!

                            PLAZA MARIACHI
                  Do�a, please -- I was just getting
                  a shine!

                            ABUELITA
                  I know your tricks, mariachi!
                      (to Miguel)
                  What did he say to you?

                            MIGUEL
                  He was just showing me his
                  guitar...

      Gasps from the family.

                            T�O BERTO
                  Shame on you!

      Abuelita lords over the mariachi, shoe aimed directly between
      his eyes.

                            ABUELITA
                  My grandson is a sweet little
                  angelito querido cielito -- he
                  wants no part of your music,
                  mariachi! You keep away from him!

      The mariachi scrambles away, snatching his hat off the
      ground before he goes. Abuelita hugs Miguel protectively to
      her bosom.

                            ABUELITA
                  Ay, pobrecito! Est�s bien, mijo?

      She peppers him with kisses then releases him from the
      embrace. He gasps for air.

                             ABUELITA
                       (distressed)
                  You know better than to be here in
                  this place! You will come home.
                  Now.




                                                                     13.


      Abuelita turns toward home. Miguel sighs and gathers his
      shine box. Then, seeing a flyer for the plaza "TALENT SHOW",
      he can't help but pocket it. He follows Abuelita.


      EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

      Miguel catches up to his family.

                             T�O BERTO
                  How many times have we told you --
                  that plaza is crawling with
                  mariachis!

                            MIGUEL
                  Yes, T�o Berto.

      Dante ambles up to Miguel, sniffing and whining for a treat.

                            MIGUEL
                  No, no, no!

      Abuelita shoos him away.

                            ABUELITA
                  Go away, you! Go!

      Dante darts off, scared.

                            MIGUEL
                  It's just Dante...

      Abuelita throws her shoe at the dog.

                             ABUELITA
                  Never name a street dog.         They'll
                  follow you forever.
                      (beat)
                  Now, go get my shoe.

                                                       CUT TO:

      INT. RIVERA WORKSHOP

      The Rivera workshop is abuzz with family making shoes.
      WHOMP! Miguel is plopped onto a stool, ready for a lecture.

                            ABUELITA
                  I found your son in Mariachi Plaza!

                            PAP�
                      (disappointed)
                  Miguel...




                                                                              14.


                             MAM�
                  You know how Abuelita feels about
                  the plaza.

                            MIGUEL
                  I was just shining shoes!

                            T�O BERTO
                  A musician's shoes!

      Gasps from the family. PRIMO ABEL (19) is so shocked he
      loses his grip on the shoe he is polishing, which zips away
      from the polisher and lodges itself in the roof.

                            MIGUEL
                  But the plaza's where all the foot
                  traffic is.

                            PAP�
                  If Abuelita says no more plaza,
                  then no more plaza.

                            MIGUEL
                      (blurting)
                  But what about tonight?

                            PAP� FRANCO
                  What's tonight?

                            MIGUEL
                  Well they're having this talent
                  show-

      Abuelita perks her ear, suspicious.          Miguel squirms, deciding
      whether to go on.

                            MIGUEL
                  And I thought I might...

      Mam� looks at Miguel, curious.

                            MAM�
                  ...Sign up?

                            MIGUEL
                  Well, maybe?

                            PRIMA ROSA
                      (laughing)
                  You have to have talent to be in a
                  talent show.





                                                                   15.


                            PRIMO ABEL
                  What are YOU going to do, shine
                  shoes?

      The shoe from the ceiling falls back down on Abel's head.

                            ABUELITA
                  It's D�a de los Muertos -- no one's
                  going anywhere. Tonight is about
                  family.

      She deposits a pile of marigolds in Miguel's arms.

                            ABUELITA
                  Ofrenda room. V�monos.

                                                   CUT TO:


      INT. OFRENDA ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Miguel follows his Abuelita to the family ofrenda, holding
      the pile of flowers as she arranges them on the altar.

                             ABUELITA
                  Don't give me that look. D�a de
                  los Muertos is the one night of the
                  year our ancestors can come visit
                  us.
                      (beat)
                  We've put their photos on the
                  ofrenda so their spirits can cross
                  over. That is very important! If
                  we don't put them up, they can't
                  come!
                      (beat)
                  We made all this food -- set out
                  the things they loved in life,
                  mijo. All this work to bring the
                  family together. I don't want you
                  sneaking off to who-knows-where.

      She looks up to find Miguel sneaking away.

                            ABUELITA (CONT'D)
                  Where are you going?

                            MIGUEL
                  I thought we were done...





                                                                 16.


                            ABUELITA
                  Ay, Dios m�o... Being part of this
                  family means being HERE for this
                  family... I don't want to see you
                  end up like--

      Abuelita looks up to the photo of the faceless musician.

                            MIGUEL
                  Like Mam� Coco's pap�?

                            ABUELITA
                  Never mention that man!      He's
                  better off forgotten.

                            MIGUEL
                  But you're the one who--

                            ABUELITA
                  Ta, ta, ta-tch!

                            MIGUEL
                  I was just--

                              ABUELITA
                  Tch-tch!

                              MIGUEL
                  But--

                              ABUELITA
                  Tch!

                              MIGUEL
                  I--

                              ABUELITA
                  Tch-tch!

                              MAM� COCO
                  Pap�?

      They look to find Mam� Coco agitated.

                            MAM� COCO (CONT'D)
                  Pap� is home...?

                            ABUELITA
                  Mam�, c�lmese, c�lmese.

                            MAM� COCO
                  Pap� is coming home?





                                                                      17.


                             ABUELITA
                  No Mam�.   It's okay, I'm here.

      Mam� Coco looks up at Abuelita.

                            MAM� COCO
                  Who are you?

      Sadness rises in Abuelita; she swallows it down.

                            ABUELITA
                  Rest, Mam�.

      Abuelita returns to the ofrenda.

                             ABUELITA (CONT'D)
                  I'm hard on you because I care,
                  Miguel.
                      (beat)
                  Miguel... Miguel?

      She looks around the room. Miguel is nowhere to be found.
      Abuelita steps up to the ofrenda.

                             ABUELITA (CONT'D)
                      (sigh)
                  What are we going to do with that
                  boy...?

      She looks to the photo of Mam� Imelda.       Abuelita's eyes
      brighten with an idea.

                            ABUELITA (CONT'D)
                  You're right. That's just what he
                  needs!

                                                    CUT TO:


      EXT. SIDE STREET

      T�o Berto unloads rolls of leather from a truckbed. Nearby,
      Dante sleeps under the shade of a tree. He startles awake by
      a faint TWANGING. The dog scrambles up to the roof.

      He reaches a shoe sign advertising the Rivera Family business
      and lifts it up.


      INT. ROOFTOP HIDEOUT

      Dante pokes his head in.      Miguel turns and gasps.





                                                                    18.


                            MIGUEL
                  Oh, it's you. Get in here, c'mon,
                  Dante. Hurry up.

      Dante wriggles into the hideout. Miguel is huddled over
      something. The dog peeks around his shoulder.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  You're gonna get me in trouble,
                  boy. Someone could hear me!

      Miguel reveals a makeshift guitar, cobbled together from a
      beat up old soundboard and random other items.

      He takes a china marker and sketches a nose on what appears
      to be his own version of a skull guitar head.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  I wish someone wanted to hear me...

      Miguel tunes the guitar.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  Other than you...

      Dante gives Miguel a big sloppy lick. Miguel gives a grossed-
      out chuckle. He lifts his guitar and strums.

                              MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  Perfecto!

      He crawls to the far side of the attic where he's built his
      own ofrenda to Ernesto de la Cruz. Posters, candles, and
      songbooks are arranged with care. Miguel lights the candles
      with reverence, illuminating an album cover of de la Cruz
      holding his skull guitar.

      Miguel compares the head of his guitar to the album cover.
      Then he imitates de la Cruz's pose and smile.

      He switches on a beat up old TV and pushes a tape into the
      VCR, "Best of de la Cruz" scrawled on the spine.

      A montage of the greatest moments from de la Cruz's films
      plays out.

      A clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:"

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  I have to sing. I have to play.
                  The music, it's -- it's not just in
                  me. It is me.





                                                                     19.


      Miguel strums his guitar as de la Cruz imparts his wisdom.
      More clips run in the background as Miguel plays:

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  When life gets me down, I play my
                  guitar.

      In a clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:"

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  The rest of the world may follow
                  the rules, but I must follow my
                  heart!

      De la Cruz kisses a woman passionately.      Miguel cringes.

      Another clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:"

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  You know that feeling? Like
                  there's a song in the air and it's
                  playing just for you...

      As Miguel watches de la Cruz play guitar in the video, he
      repeats the melody on his own guitar.

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                      (singing)
                  A FEELING SO CLOSE
                  YOU COULD REACH OUT AND TOUCH IT
                  I NEVER KNEW I COULD
                  WANT SOMETHING SO MUCH
                  BUT IT'S TRUE...

      As a good-natured priest in "NUESTRA IGLESIA:"

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  You must have faith, sister.

                            NUN (FILM CLIP)
                  Oh but Padre, he will never listen.

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  He will listen... to MUSIC!
                      (singing)
                  ONLY A SONG
                  ONLY A SONG
                  HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE A HEART...

      Miguel loses himself in the music.





                                                                         20.


                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  Never underestimate the power of
                  music...

      Miguel's tune intertwines with the melodies on the TV set.
      The clip jumps forward:

                            LOLA (FILM CLIP)
                  But my father, he will never give
                  his permission.

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  I am done asking permission. When
                  you see your moment you mustn't let
                  it pass you by, you must seize it!

      The tape ends with an interview clip.

                            INTERVIEWER (FILM CLIP)
                  Se�or de la Cruz, what did it take
                  for you to seize your moment?

                             DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  I had to have faith in my dream.
                  No one was going to hand it to me.
                  It was up to me to reach for that
                  dream, grab it tight, and make it
                  come true.

                            MIGUEL
                  ...and make it come true.

      The tape ends. The words sink into Miguel.        He reaches for
      the flyer for the plaza "TALENT SHOW."

                            MIGUEL
                  No more hiding, Dante.      I gotta
                  seize my moment!

      Dante wags his tail, panting happily.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if
                  it kills me!

                                                    CUT TO:


      EXT. RIVERA COMPOUND - SUNSET

      Children run by with sparklers as Abuelita opens the doors to
      the family compound.





                                                                      21.


                            ABUELITA
                  D�a de los Muertos has begun!

      In the courtyard, two TODDLER COUSINS haphazardly scatter
      marigold petals from their baskets.

                            MAM�
                  No, no, no, no, no.

      Mam� corrects them, creating a path from the ofrenda room to
      the front gate.

                            MAM� (CONT'D)
                  We have to make a clear path. The
                  petals guide our ancestors home. We
                  don't want their spirits to get
                  lost. We want them to come, and
                  enjoy all the food and drinks on
                  the ofrenda, s�?

      As Mam� teaches, Miguel and Dante sneak across the roof and
      drop to the sidewalk outside the compound, Miguel clutching
      his guitar.

      Suddenly T�o Berto and Pap� round the corner carrying a small
      table from storage.

                            PAP�
                  Mam�, where should we put this
                  table?

      Miguel and Dante back up to avoid the adults, only to find
      Abuelita sweeping the sidewalk behind them! Miguel and Dante
      jump into the back into the Rivera courtyard before she sees
      them.

                            ABUELITA
                  In the courtyard, mijos.

                            PAP�
                  You want it down by the kitchen?

                             ABUELITA
                  S�.   Next to the other one.


      INT. OFRENDA ROOM

      Miguel backs out of the courtyard and into the family ofrenda
      room. Nearly cornered, he ushers Dante past a sleeping Mam�
      Coco. He stashes the dog and the guitar under the ofrenda
      table.





                                                                         22.


                            MIGUEL
                  Get under, get under!

                              ABUELITA (O.S.)
                  Miguel!

      Miguel straightens up to notice the doorway of the ofrenda
      room darkened by three figures.

                              MIGUEL
                  Nothing!

      His Abuelita and parents stare straight at him.     A pit grows
      in his stomach; he's been caught.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  Mam� -- Pap�, I--

      Pap� lifts his finger to silence his son.

                             PAP�
                  Miguel...
                      (beat)
                  Your Abuelita had the most
                  wonderful idea!
                      (beat)
                  We've all decided -- it's time you
                  joined us in the workshop!

      Abuelita hands Pap� a leather apron, which he hangs over
      Miguel's shoulders.

                              MIGUEL
                  What?!

                            PAP�
                  No more shining shoes -- you will
                  be making them! Every day after
                  school!

      Abuelita shuffles toward Miguel squealing.      She squeezes his
      cheeks, full of pride.

                            ABUELITA
                  Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on
                  the family tradition! And on D�a
                  de los Muertos! Your ancestors
                  will be so proud!

      She gestures to the shoes adorning the ofrenda.





                                                                      23.


                            ABUELITA (CONT'D)
                  You'll craft huaraches just like
                  your T�a Victoria.

                            PAP�
                  And wingtips, like your Pap� Julio--

      Miguel crosses away from the ofrenda.

                            MIGUEL
                  But what if I'm no good at making
                  shoes?

                             PAP�
                  Ah, Migue... You have your family
                  here to guide you...
                      (beat)
                  You are a Rivera. And a Rivera
                  is...?

                            MIGUEL
                  ...A shoemaker. Through and
                  through.

      Pap� swells.

                            PAP�
                  That's my boy!
                      (calling out)
                  Berto, break out the good stuff, I
                  wanna make a toast!

      Pap� heads out of the room, Mam� follows. Last is Abuelita,
      who smothers Miguel with tons of kisses as she leaves.

      With the family gone, Miguel deflates.

      Suddenly, a noise comes from the ofrenda. Miguel turns to
      find Dante on the bottom tier, licking a plate of mole to his
      heart's content. Miguel is horrified!

                             MIGUEL
                  Dante!   No, Dante, stop!

      Miguel pulls the dog away from the ofrenda, but the table
      shakes. The frame with Mam� Imelda's photo sways back and
      forth, then topples to the ground with a sickening crack.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  No, no, no, no, no! No...

      Miguel picks up the old photo of Mam� Imelda, which unfolds
      to reveal another portion, hidden all these years;




                                                                      24.


      the man with no face is revealed to be holding a familiar
      skull-headed guitar.

                            MIGUEL
                  De la Cruz's guitar...?

                              MAM� COCO
                  Pap�?

      Miguel turns, startled. Mam� Coco points a crooked finger at
      the picture in his hand.

                              MAM� COCO (CONT'D)
                  Pap�?

      Miguel's eyes go wide as the connection dawns on him.   Could
      it possibly be true?

                            MIGUEL
                  Mam� Coco, is your pap�... Ernesto
                  de la Cruz?

                             MAM� COCO
                  Pap�!   Pap�!

                                                   CUT TO:


      INT. ROOFTOP HIDEOUT

      Miguel goes to his secret ofrenda, to the record album of
      Ernesto de la Cruz. He compares the guitar in the family
      photo with the guitar on the sleeve. An exact match!

                              MIGUEL
                  Ha, ha!


      EXT. ROOFTOP

      Miguel runs to the edge of the roof, overlooking the
      courtyard, photo in one hand, guitar in the other.

                             MIGUEL
                  Pap�!   Pap�!

      His parents stop, looking up at Miguel.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  It's him! I know who my great-
                  great grandfather was!





                                                                     25.


                             MAM�
                  Miguel!   Get down from there!

                            MIGUEL
                  Mam� Coco's father was Ernesto de
                  la Cruz!

                            PAP�
                  What are you talking about?

      Miguel whips off his shoemaker's apron, striking a pose with
      the guitar.

                            MIGUEL
                  I'm gonna be a musician!

                                                   CUT TO:


      EXT. COURTYARD - EARLY EVENING

      Miguel's guitar is cast at his feet, along with his de la
      Cruz albums. The whole family encircles the boy.

                            ABUELITA
                  What is all this? You keep secrets
                  from your own family?

                            T�O BERTO
                  It's all that time he spends in the
                  plaza...

                             T�A GLORIA
                  ...Fills his head with crazy
                  fantasies!

                            MIGUEL
                  It's not a fantasy!

      Miguel hands Pap� the photo and points to the skull guitar.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  That man was Ernesto de la Cruz!
                  The greatest musician of all time!

                            PAP�
                  We've never known anything about
                  this man. But whoever he was, he
                  still abandoned his family. This
                  is no future for my son.





                                                                         26.


                            MIGUEL
                  But Pap�, you said my family would
                  guide me! Well de la Cruz IS my
                  family! I'm supposed to play
                  music!

                              ABUELITA
                  Never!    That man's music was a
                  curse!    I will not allow it!

                            MIGUEL
                  If you would just let--

                            MAM�
                      (warning)
                  Miguel--

                            PAP�
                  You will listen to your family.    No
                  more music.

                            MIGUEL
                  Just listen to me play--

                            PAP�
                  End of argument.

      Miguel lifts his guitar to play when Abuelita snatches the
      instrument away. She points to the man in the photo.

                            ABUELITA
                  You want to end up like that man?
                  Forgotten? Left off your family's
                  ofrenda?!

                            MIGUEL
                  I don't care if I'm on some stupid
                  ofrenda!

      Gasps from the family.      Abuelita's brow hardens.   She lifts
      the guitar in the air.

                              MIGUEL
                  No!

                              PAP�
                  Mam�...

      Abuelita smashes it to bits!

                            ABUELITA
                  There. No guitar, no music.
                      (softening)
                            (MORE)


                                                                    27.

                            ABUELITA (CONT'D)
                  Come. You'll feel better after you
                  eat with your family.

      She reaches out to comfort Miguel, but he is hurt beyond
      repair.

                            MIGUEL
                  I don't wanna be in this family!

      He snatches the photo from Pap� and bolts out of the
      hacienda.

                             PAP�
                  Miguel!   MIGUEL!


      EXT. SIDE STREET

      Miguel bursts out of the compound, desperate to get away.
      Dante, nose buried in a trash bag, hears Miguel and chases
      after him. Miguel runs past a poster for the plaza "TALENT
      SHOW."


      EXT. MARIACHI PLAZA - EVENING

      Miguel approaches a STAGE MANAGER in the gazebo.

                            MIGUEL
                  I wanna play in the plaza. Like de
                  la Cruz! Can I still sign-up?

                            STAGE MANAGER
                  You got an instrument?

                            MIGUEL
                  No... But if I can borrow a guitar--

                            STAGE MANAGER
                  Musicians gotta bring their own
                  instruments...
                      (walking away)
                  You find a guitar, kid, I'll put
                  you on the list.

      Miguel looks distraught.

                                                   MOMENTS LATER:

      Miguel approaches any musician he can find.





                                                                           28.


                            MIGUEL
                  Excuse me, can I borrow your
                  guitar?

                            MUSICIAN #1
                  Sorry, muchacho.

                                                      CUT TO:

                            MIGUEL
                  You guys have a spare guitar?

                              MUSICIAN #2
                  No.

                                                      CUT TO:

                            MIGUEL
                  I need a guitar, just for a little
                  bit--

                            MUSICIAN #3
                  Get outta here, kid!

      Disheartened, Miguel walks away.       He finds himself facing the
      statue of de la Cruz.

                            MIGUEL
                  Great-great grandfather... What am
                  I supposed to do?

      No answer. Miguel's gaze falls on a plaque at the base of
      the statue that reads "Seize Your Moment!" Miguel looks at
      the photo in his hand. He moves his thumb to reveal the
      skull head guitar. Then, a firework illuminates the skull
      head guitar that the statue holds. Miguel gets an idea.


      EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

      A sea of candles and flowers, families gathered at graves.

      Miguel sneaks through the cemetery unnoticed, slipping from
      one shadow to the next.

      Dante suddenly catches up to Miguel.         He barks excitedly.

                            MIGUEL
                  No, no, no, no, no, Dante stop!
                  C�llate! Shhh!

      Miguel swipes a chicken leg off a neighboring grave, and
      chucks it. Dante bounds after the food.




                                                                      29.


      EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM

      Miguel slinks around the side of the tomb.   He looks in one
      of the windows.

      Inside, the famous guitar hangs above the crypt. Fireworks
      pop; bursts of light glint off the instrument. It seems to
      beckon him. He tries the window but it's locked.

      More fireworks shoot into the sky.

                            MIGUEL
                  I'm sorry...

      Timing to the explosions, Miguel throws his shoulder into the
      rusted-shut window pane and forces it open with a scraping
      KRRRR-LANK! He slinks inside the tomb.


      INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM

      Miguel drops down to the mausoleum floor. The noise from
      outside is muffled. He climbs onto the crypt, slightly
      moving the lid. He stifles a gasp.

      He crawls over the marble sarcophagus and comes face-to-face
      with the famed guitar. Miguel wipes away a layer of dust,
      revealing the rich painted wood beneath. He looks up to the
      portrait of de la Cruz.

                            MIGUEL
                  Se�or de la Cruz? Please don't be
                  mad. I'm Miguel, your great-great
                  grandson... I need to borrow this.

      Heart in his throat, Miguel lifts the guitar off its mount.
      Unbeknownst to him, some marigold petals in the mausoleum
      begin to sparkle.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  Our family thinks music is a curse.
                  None of them understand, but I know
                  you would have. You would've told
                  me to follow my heart. To seize my
                  moment!

      He backs up, in full view of the painting.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  So if it's all right with you, I'm
                  gonna play in the plaza, just like
                  you did!





                                                                      30.


      Confidence building, he strums it once.

      The air around him vibrates -- radiating like a shock wave.
      The petals on the ground whirl and surge with light for just
      a moment. Miguel is visibly taken aback. What just
      happened?

      Suddenly, a flashlight shines in the window of the mausoleum.

                            VOICES (O.S.)
                  The guitar! It's gone! Somebody
                  stole de la Cruz's guitar! The
                  window's broken, look.

      Miguel hears keys jangling and the door unlocking.   A
      GROUNDSKEEPER enters with a flashlight.

                            GROUNDSKEEPER
                  Alright, who's in there?

      Startled, Miguel puts down the guitar.

                            MIGUEL
                  I... I'm sorry! It's not what it
                  looks like! De la Cruz is my...

      The groundskeeper walks straight through Miguel!   He doesn't
      even see him!

                            GROUNDSKEEPER
                  There's nobody here!


      EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

      A panicked Miguel runs out, trying to figure out what's going
      on! But the people in the cemetery walk through him too.

      Suddenly he hears a familiar voice.

                              MAM�
                  Miguel!

      Miguel turns to see Pap� and Mam� still searching for him.

                              MIGUEL
                  Mam�!

                             PAP�
                  Miguel!   Come home!

      He reaches for his parents, but goes straight through them.





                                                                          31.


                            PAP�
                  Where are you, Miguel?!

      Frantic, Miguel trips and falls into an open grave.      A nearby
      woman gasps and peeks over the ledge of the grave.

                              WOMAN
                  Dios m�o!    Little boy, are you
                  okay?

      She reaches into the grave.

                            WOMAN (CONT'D)
                  Here, let me help you.

      Miguel takes her hand and she pulls him out.

                            MIGUEL
                  Thanks, I--

      They see each other face to face.       The woman is a skeleton!
      Miguel screams! She does too!

      Miguel backs away. He turns to see another skeleton. He
      falls backwards and scoots away frantically. He bumps into
      another skeleton whose head falls off and lands in Miguel's
      hands.

                            SKELETON HEAD
                  Do you mind?

                              MIGUEL
                  Ahhh!

                              SKELETON HEAD
                  Ahhh!

                              MIGUEL
                  AHHH!

      Miguel tosses the head away from him and turns to see the
      whole cemetery is teeming with skeletons! And they can all
      see him!

      He races off and hides behind a grave. After a moment, he
      peeks over the headstone to watch the skeletons engaging with
      their living families.

      One couple dances.

      Another man reaches for offerings on his grave, which
      solidify in his hands when he takes them.





                                                                    32.


      A couple of skeletons coo over a toddler.

                            SKELETON ABUELA
                  Look how big she's getting!

      Suddenly Dante surprises Miguel and licks him on the cheek.
      Miguel screams.

                            MIGUEL
                  Dante?! You can see me?          W-wait!
                  What's going on?!

      Dante barks, points, and bounds through the crowd.

                              MIGUEL
                  Dante!    Dante!

      Miguel gives chase until -� BAM! He runs smack into a
      mustached skeleton and falls to the ground. The skeleton's
      bones break apart and scatter. The head pops up.

                            MIGUEL
                  I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

                              PAP� JULIO
                  Miguel?!

      Miguel tries to gather the scattered bones.

                              T�A ROSITA
                  Miguel?

                              T�A VICTORIA
                  Miguel?

      The bones magically pull away from Miguel.

                            PAP� JULIO
                  You're here! HERE here!

      PAP� JULIO reconstitutes himself.

                            PAP� JULIO (CONT'D)
                  And you can see us?!

      T�A ROSITA charges through Pap� Julio, sending his bones
      scattering again. She grabs Miguel, hugging him tight.

                            T�A ROSITA
                  Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-ti-to!

      Miguel, smothered by Rosita's ample ribcage, struggles for
      air.




                                                                      33.


                            MIGUEL
                      (muffled)
                  Remind me how I know you?

                            T�A ROSITA
                  We're your family, mijo!

      T�a Rosita's ofrenda photo flashes in Miguel's memory.

                            MIGUEL
                  T�a... Rosita?

                               T�A ROSITA
                  S�!

      He looks at Pap� Julio, whose head is still turned the wrong
      way. T�A VICTORIA straightens it.

                            MIGUEL
                  Pap� Julio?

                               PAP� JULIO
                  Hola.

                            MIGUEL
                  T�a Victoria?

      T�a Victoria pokes Miguel's cheek, skeptical.

                            T�A VICTORIA
                  He doesn't seem entirely dead.

      A living person ambles through Miguel's non-corporeal form.

                            T�A ROSITA
                  He's not quite alive either...

                            PAP� JULIO
                  We need Mam� Imelda. She'll know
                  how to fix this!

      Suddenly twin skeleton gents run, huffing, toward the family.

                               T�O FELIPE
                         (huffing)
                  Oye!

                            T�O OSCAR
                      (winded)
                  It's Mam� Imelda--





                                                                       34.


                            T�O FELIPE
                      (huffing)
                  --She couldn't cross over!

      The others gasp.

                            T�O OSCAR
                  She's stuck--

                            T�O FELIPE
                  --On the other side!

      Miguel sees pictures of his T�o Oscar and T�o Felipe flash in
      his memory.

                               MIGUEL
                  T�o Oscar?     T�o Felipe?

                            T�O OSCAR
                  Oh, hey Miguel.

      T�a Victoria turns her gaze on Miguel.

                            T�A VICTORIA
                  I have a feeling this has something
                  to do with you.

                            T�A ROSITA
                  But if Mam� Imelda can't come to
                  us...

                            PAP� JULIO
                  ...Then we are going to her!
                  V�monos!

      Pap� Julio grabs Miguel by the arm and the family rushes
      through the cemetery, trailed by Dante.


      EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

      Miguel and his family weave through the graves, rounding a
      corner.

      His gaze falls upon a glowing MARIGOLD BRIDGE arching before
      them.

                               MIGUEL
                  Whoa...

      The bridge extends into the mist.        A stream of skeletons
      amble across for the holiday.





                                                                      35.


      The family passes through an invisible barrier onto the
      bridge. Their bodies change from ghostly to solid. Miguel
      hesitates at the threshold.

                            PAP� JULIO
                  Come on, Miguel. It's ok.

      Miguel follows after the family, the petals glowing under his
      feet. Dante takes off.

                             MIGUEL
                  Dante!   Dante! Dante, wait up!

      Miguel runs after Dante, finally catching up to the dog as he
      rolls in the petals at the crest of the bridge. He sneezes
      some petals into Miguel's face.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  You gotta stay with me, boy.       We
                  don't know... where...

      Out of the mist, the sparkling cityscape of the Land of the
      Dead emerges. It's breathtaking. His family sidles up.

                            MIGUEL
                  This isn't a dream, then.        You're
                  all really out there...

                            T�A VICTORIA
                  You thought we weren't?

                            MIGUEL
                  Well I don't know, I thought it
                  might've been one of those made up
                  things that adults tell kids...
                  like... vitamins.

                            T�A VICTORIA
                  Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.

                            MIGUEL
                  Well, now I'm thinking maybe they
                  could be...

      As skeletons pass in the other direction, Miguel receives
      some strange looks. A little skeleton girl gasps, pointing
      at him.

                            SKELETON MOTHER
                  Mija, it's not nice to stare at--
                      (seeing Miguel)
                  Ay! Santa Maria!





                                                                     36.


      The woman goes wide-eyed, her head turning backwards to gawk
      at Miguel as she walks in the opposite direction. Miguel
      puts up his hood.

      The Riveras continue on toward an arrivals area on the far
      side of the bridge. Miguel sees fantastical creatures
      crawling, flying, making nests in the nearby architecture.

                            MIGUEL
                  Are those...? Alebrijes!         But
                  those are--

                            T�O OSCAR
                  REAL alebrijes. Spirit
                  creatures...

                             T�A ROSITA
                  They guide souls on their
                  journey...

                            T�O FELIPE
                  Watch your step, they make caquitas
                  everywhere.

      They get to the far edge of the Marigold Bridge.

      EXT. MARIGOLD GRAND CENTRAL STATION

                            CANNED LOOP (V.O.)

      A sign reads RE-ENTRY.

                            ARRIVALS AGENT
                  Welcome back! Anything to declare?

                            TRAVELER
                  Some churros... from my family.

      Miguel and family get into the line for RE-ENTRY, along with
      other skeletons returning from the Land of the Living.




                                                                      37.


      Nearby, skeletons exit the Land of the Dead through a gate
      marked DEPARTURES. Miguel watches.

                            DEPARTURES AGENT
                  Next family, please!

      An ELDERLY COUPLE steps in front of a camera-mounted monitor.
      The monitor scans their faces and returns an image of their
      photos on an altar in the Land of the Living.

                            DEPARTURES AGENT (CONT'D)
                  Oh, your photos are on your son's

                               ELDERLY COUPLE
                  Gracias.

      The couple unites with the rest of their family. They all
      step onto the bridge, which begins to glow as they gain
      footing.

                            CANNED LOOP (V.O.)
                  ...And remember to return before

                  Next!

      A skeleton man, a smile full of braces, steps up to the
      monitor.

                            DEPARTURES AGENT (CONT'D)
                  Your photo's on your dentist's
                  ofrenda. Enjoy your visit!

      H�CTOR (early 20s), a ragged fellow, steps up to the monitor,
      disguised as Frida Kahlo.

                             H�CTOR
                  Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo.
                      (beat)
                  Shall we skip the scanner? I'm on
                  so many ofrendas, it'll just
                  overwhelm your blinky thingie...

      The monitor scans him, but an "X" appears, accompanied by a
      negative buzzing sound.




                                                                         38.


                            DEPARTURES AGENT
                  Well shoot. Looks like no one put
                  up your photo, Frida...

      H�ctor peels off his unibrow and throws off his frock.

                            H�CTOR
                  Okay, when I said I was Frida...
                  just now? That... that was a lie.
                  And I apologize for doing that.

                            DEPARTURES AGENT
                  No photo on an ofrenda, no crossing
                  the bridge.

                            H�CTOR
                  You know what, I'm just gonna zip
                  right over, you won't even know I'm
                  gone.

      H�ctor bolts for the bridge. A security guards blocks the
      gate. H�ctor splits in two and slides past the guard, half
      going over, half under.

                              H�CTOR
                  Ha HA!

      H�ctor reaches the bridge at a sprint, but the magic doesn't
      engage; he sinks right into the petals.

                            H�CTOR
                  Almost there, just a little
                  further...!

      The guards saunter to the bridge and casually pull H�ctor
      back toward the Land of the Dead.

                            OFFICER
                  Upsy-daisy...

                            H�CTOR
                  Fine, okay. Fine, who cares...
                  Dumb flower bridge!

      Miguel watches as the guards haul him out.      T�a Rosita looks
      up in time to see his back.

                            T�A ROSITA
                  I don't know what I'd do if no one
                  put up my photo.

                  Oh!   Come mijo, it's our turn.

      The arrivals line moves forward. The Dead Riveras crowd
      around the gate. The arrivals agent leans out from his
      window.

                            ARRIVALS AGENT

                            PAP� JULIO
                  As a matter of fact, yes.

      The family pushes Miguel to the front, very much alive.

                              MIGUEL
                  Hola.

      The arrivals agent's jaw literally drops.

                                                    CUT TO:


      INT. MARIGOLD GRAND CENTRAL STATION

      Miguel and his family are escorted by a security guard across
      an arching second floor walkway.

                            VOICE OVER P.A.
                  Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos. Marta
                  Gonzales-Ramos, please report to
                  Level 7.

      Dante happily trots alongside.       Miguel looks up to see
      gondolas traveling by.

                              MIGUEL
                  Whoa...

      Skeletons stare at Miguel as he walks by. Suddenly Miguel
      notices T�o Oscar staring at his face in deep contemplation.

                            T�O OSCAR
                  I miss my nose...

      At the end of the walkway are doors emblazoned with
      "DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY REUNIONS." The family passes through.

      INT. DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY REUNIONS

      Inside, they find case workers helping travelers work out
      holiday snafus.




                                                                     40.


                             DISTRESSED TRAVELER
                  C'mon! Help us out amigo... We
                  gotta get to a dozen ofrendas
                  tonight...

                                                   CUT TO:

                            MIFFED WIFE
                  We are NOT visiting your ex-wife's
                  family for D�a de Muertos!

                                                   CUT TO:

      In a far corner, one traveler in particular is raising hell.

                            MAM� IMELDA
                  I demand to speak to the person in
                  charge!

      A beleaguered CASE WORKER cringes as Mam� Imelda tears into
      her.

                            CASE WORKER
                  I'm sorry, se�ora, it says here no
                  one put up your photo--

      Mam� Imelda coldly eyes the Macintosh 128k on the woman's
      desk.

                            MAM� IMELDA
                  My family always -- ALWAYS -- puts
                  my photo on the ofrenda! That
                  devil box tells you nothing but
                  lies!

      In a swift movement, Mam� Imelda removes her shoe and smacks
      the computer.

                            PAP� JULIO
                  Mam� Imelda?

      She turns her shoe on Pap� Julio, who leans back and yelps.
      Mam� Imelda softens.

                            MAM� IMELDA
                  Oh, mi familia! They wouldn't let
                  me cross the bridge! Tell this
                  woman and her devil box that my
                  photo is on the ofrenda.

                             PAP� JULIO
                  Well, we never made it to the
                  ofrenda...




                                                                         41.


                               MAM� IMELDA
                  What?!

                            PAP� JULIO
                  We ran into... um...

      Mam� Imelda's eyes fall on Miguel.

      Miguel looks at Mam� Imelda.       Her photo flashes before him.

                               MAM� IMELDA
                  Miguel?

                            MIGUEL
                  Mam� Imelda...

                            MAM� IMELDA
                  What is going on?

      Just then, a door opens and a CLERK pokes his head out.

                            CLERK
                  You the Rivera family?

      The computer short circuits.

                                                    CUT TO:


      INT. CLERK'S OFFICE

                            CLERK
                  Well, you're cursed.

      The family gasps.

                               MIGUEL
                  What?!

      The clerk searches through a huge stack of papers.

                            CLERK
                  D�a de los Muertos is a night to
                  GIVE to the dead. You STOLE from
                  the dead.

                            MIGUEL
                  But I wasn't stealing the guitar!

                               MAM� IMELDA
                  Guitar...?





                                                                    42.


                            MIGUEL
                  It was my great-great
                  grandfather's, he would have wanted
                  me to have it--

                            MAM� IMELDA
                  Ah-ah-ah! We do not speak of
                  that...
                      (disgust)
                  ...musician! He is DEAD to this
                  family!

                            MIGUEL
                  Uh, you're all dead.

      Dante balances his paws at the edge of the clerk's desk and
      tries to reach a plate of food.

                           CLERK
                  ACHOO! I am sorry, whose alebrije
                  is that?

      Miguel steps up, trying to pull Dante away from the treats.

                            MIGUEL
                  That's just Dante.

                            T�A ROSITA
                  He sure doesn't look like an
                  alebrije.

      T�a Rosita gestures to the fantastical creatures fluttering
      on the other side of the window.

                            T�O OSCAR
                  He just looks like a plain old
                  dog...

                            T�O FELIPE
                  ...Or a sausage someone dropped in
                  a barbershop.

                            CLERK
                  Whatever he is, I am -- ACHOO! --
                  terribly allergic.

                            MIGUEL
                  But Dante doesn't have any hair.

                            CLERK
                  And I don't have a nose, and yet
                  here we are -- ACHOO!!





                                                                      43.


                            MAM� IMELDA
                  But none of this explains why I
                  couldn't cross over.

      Miguel realizes something.        He sheepishly pulls out the
      folded photo.

                               MIGUEL
                  Oh...

      He unfolds the photo.

                            MAM� IMELDA
                  You took my photo off the ofrenda?!

                            MIGUEL
                  It was an accident!

      Mam� Imelda turns to the clerk, fire in her eyes.

                            MAM� IMELDA
                  How do we send him back?!

                            CLERK
                  Well, since it's a family matter...
                      (flipping pages)
                  The way to undo a family curse is
                  to get your family's blessing.

                               MIGUEL
                  That's it?

                            CLERK
                  Get your family's blessing, and
                  everything SHOULD go back to
                  normal. But you gotta do it by
                  sunrise!

                            MIGUEL
                  What happens at sunrise?

                             PAP� JULIO
                  H�jole!   Your hand!

      Miguel looks at his hand. The tip of one of his fingers has
      started to turn skeletal. He turns pale. He starts to faint
      when Pap� Julio picks him up and gently slaps him awake.

                            PAP� JULIO
                  Whoa, Miguel. Can't have you
                  fainting on us.
