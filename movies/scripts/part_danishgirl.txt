EXT. KATTEGAT SEA, JUTLAND, DENMARK, 1920'S, DAY

FADE IN:

A rectangle of ferociously stormy sea viewed from battered
cliffs. Silver waves are whipped by a wind that flies at us,
stinging, relentless. Somewhere, unseen in the barren
landscape, something is at its mercy - we hear the RUSTLE and
PUNCH of the weather going at it...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:


INT. WOMAN'S EYE

The same scene reflected across the surface of a woman's
brown eye, intense with emotion, curiosity. Gradually, the
WEATHER SOUNDS are overtaken by VOICES coming up. At first
the SOCIAL CHATTER is PERIPHERAL, then the VOICES grow more
STRIDENT, OPPRESSIVE. The eye blinks.


INT. GALLERY, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, EVENING

A painting of the same sea, captured with remarkable accuracy
of feeling. A HUBBUB OF GABBLING VOICES. Too many people in
a low-ceilinged room. One voice dominates now -

                     OLDER WOMAN (O.S.)
           Don't you wish you could paint like
           that?

We pull out to see GERDA WEGENER'S brown eyes shift from deep      *
scrutiny of the painting to polite social focus as she takes
in an excited OLDER WOMAN.

                     GERDA
           I'm sorry...?

                     OLDER WOMAN
           I said, don't you wish you could
           paint like your husband? Really - you must
           be so proud...

The woman smiles and heads into the crowd, leaving Gerda to
consider... Gerda's gaze travels across the well-dressed
gathering. Far off in a corner, there's an inner circle
where her handsome husband EINAR WEGENER is being showered
with praise. A portly goateed man dominates the scene -
RASMUSSEN, Einar's dealer.

                     RASMUSSEN
           They're all Veijle, where he grew
           up.

CONTINUED:

Gerda begins walking toward them through the throng...

                       RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
             And I don't say my client is
             the best landscape artist in
             Denmark... but, he is in the top
             one!

Einar cringes as the crowd laughs, delighted. An exotic-
looking woman with mischief playing on her full lips
approaches Gerda. This is ULLA FONSMARCK. They're friends.

                       ULLA
                 (a stage whisper)
             It's going very well.

                        GERDA
             Oh yes.   He'll be impossible.

The women LAUGH. As Gerda looks up, Einar looks across,
smiles, trapped in his corner. Gerda nods back, reassuring,
conspiratorial. Then Einar's pulled back into the select
circle and Rasmussen emits a ridiculous barking LAUGH.


EXT. COPENHAGEN STREET, NIGHT

Gerda and Einar, arm in arm, LAUGHING. Gerda wears a
distinctively embroidered fine wool wrap. Their FOOTSTEPS
ring down the empty street. A patina of crystallised brine
coats doorways, windows, scintillating in the moonlight.

                       GERDA
             And Rasmussen...

                       EINAR
             Oh, come on. Be kind.
             At least he agreed to see your work.


                       GERDA
             Only because he was drunk!

                          EINAR
             I know.

                       GERDA
             You were loving it!

                          EINAR
             I was not.

She mimics Rasmussen, his ludicrous excitement:

                       GERDA
             "I don't say my client is the best
             landscape artist in Denmark..."

                                                      (CONTINUED)
                                                    26/11/15
                                                         3.
CONTINUED:

                        EINAR
             "But..."

                       GERDA
             "He is in the top one!"

They LAUGH hard.     Someone calls from an upstairs window:

                       MAN AT WINDOW
             Hey - people are sleeping!

The window SLAMS. Gerda and Einar struggle to quieten down,
head for the dancing harbour lights - partners in crime.


EXT. HARBOUR, NEXT MORNING

- MAIN TITLES BEGIN -

Fishermen selling straight off the boats to early-rising
customers. Prices are loudly negotiated as the silver catch
still writhes and flaps. A city coming to life.


INT. THE WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, MORNING

Gerda carries in a breakfast tray. Einar sleeps. She observes
his face: long eyelashes, cheeks hollow in repose, delicate
lips. A little dog, HVAPPE, trots beside her. She puts down
the tray and throws back the bedcover. Einar blinks in the
light, surprised. He stretches, takes in the silhouetted
outline of his wife: tall, purposeful Gerda.

                       GERDA
             Do you know what time it is?

He smiles, sweetly suggestive of pleasure to come...

                       EINAR
             Time you came back to bed?

                       GERDA
             No - I'm ready to start work.

                       EINAR
             Draw down the blinds.

She holds back, teases a little.

                       GERDA
             I told you, I...

                        EINAR
             Gerda...

                        GERDA
             What?

                                                     (CONTINUED)
                                                   26/11/15
                                                            4.
CONTINUED:

She takes him in, smiling up at her.     Shakes her head.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Your face... You think I can't resist
             you...

                       EINAR
             Do you want to resist me?

She approaches the edge of the bed, smiling herself now.

                       GERDA
             No. But I'd like you to ask nicely
             so I don't feel such a pushover...

Einar reaches towards her.

                       EINAR
             Gerda Wegener - my life, my wife...

He pulls her into bed... A skittish piano comes up as they
laugh, begin to make love. Continues over:


EXT. STREET OUTSIDE COPENHAGEN OPERA HOUSE

Einar crosses the road, heads for the Opera House.


INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR

Einar greets the doorman, THORBJORN.

                          EINAR
             Thorbjorn.

                       STAGE DOORMAN
             Mr Wegener.


INT. OPERA HOUSE, COSTUME SHOP, ONE MONTH LATER, DAY

Einar walks between racks of clothes that hang in two tiers
so the ruffled and feathered hems of jewel-coloured gowns
brush his cheeks. An explicit sensual pleasure, which Einar
is conscious of but feels no need to investigate. He pauses.
The ARIA ceases, he hears women CHATTING, sometimes DROPPING
THEIR VOICES, emitting DIRTY LAUGHS, which make him smile and
wonder. A stolen intimacy. Einar spies on Ulla, below -

                          ULLA (O.S.)
             Tighter!

Ulla is being pulled into a corset by a DRESSER. Einar leans
forward for a better view... She spots him - is delighted,
breaks free for a moment.

CONTINUED:

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             Einar Wegener!

The DRESSER hands Ulla a robe to cover up, but:

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             Oh don't worry about him - he's only ever
             had eyes for one woman.

                       EINAR
             My guilty secret's out.

He smiles at her, indulgent.      She calls up to him -

                       ULLA
             So - when are you two going to breed me a
             godchild?

                       EINAR
             You're an atheist.

                       ULLA
             I'll reconsider.

                       EINAR
             We're trying.

                       ULLA
             Try harder. I've been waiting an eternity.
             Have you tried drinking raw eggs?

                        EINAR
             No.

                        ULLA
             Do it.   For my sake.

Einar shakes his head.     She's impossible and he adores her.

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             Anyway what are you doing in today? I
             thought you finished last week?

                       EINAR
             I wanted to check on the scrim for the
             storm scene. And give Gerda some space.

                       ULLA
             Ah - she's got a shy one.

Einar nods, smiles.     Ulla prepares to resume her fitting.

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             You know I'm next?

                       EINAR
             So I heard.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                           6.
CONTINUED:

                       ULLA
             I won't be shy.

                       EINAR
             I should imagine not.

                       ULLA
             Good God, she'll need all her colours for
             me!

They LAUGH and Ulla signals to the dresser to pull at the
corset once more, smiles in delighted anticipation of the
discomfort to come.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, DAY

MR FONNESBECH in a chair on a slightly raised dais. He is
formally dressed, somewhat stiff. The room is oppressively
still. Gerda looks up from her canvas, goes to adjust
Fonnesbech's arm. He is clearly affected by being touched,
embarrassed. She returns to the canvas. After an
uncomfortable couple of moments:

                       FONNESBECH
             I wanted to say... I appreciate our being
             alone today. I hope your husband doesn't
             mind.

                       GERDA
             Not at all. I could see his being here
             made you uncomfortable.

                       FONNESBECH
             It wasn't personal.

Gerda smiles.      Shakes her head - he shouldn't worry:

                       GERDA
             It's not uncommon.

                        FONNESBECH
             Ah.

Fonnesbech's relieved.     Though he's left with questions.

                       GERDA
             It's hard for a man to be looked at by a
             woman. Women are used to it, of course,
             but for a man...

Mr Fonnesbech begins to look wildly vulnerable.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             To... submit to a woman's gaze.   It's
             unsettling...

Fonnesbech nods, relieved - that's exactly it.

CONTINUED:

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Although I believe there's some pleasure to
             be had from it, once you...

She smiles mischievously.

                          GERDA (cont'd)
             ...yield.

Fonnesbech swallows, cheeks pinking.       Suddenly:

                          GERDA (cont'd)
             Sit!

Fonnesbech flinches.       The dog settles.   Fonnesbech exhales.

                          GERDA (cont'd)
             Good girl.

Gerda returns to work, eyes glinting at what she's revealed
in her sitter: finally getting somewhere.


EXT. WIDOW HOUSE, MONTHS LATER

A CHINESE LAUNDRESS with a large wheeled cart makes her way
along the street, RINGING a pair of little BELLS as she goes.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, MORNING

Einar quickly but carefully folds Gerda's chemise and puts it
in a bag of laundry, hurries to open the door...


INT/EXT. WIDOW HOUSE, EARLY MORNING, A MONTH LATER

Einar hands the bag to the laundress as she passes.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, MORNING

Gerda at the mirror, putting on her lipstick. Einar comes
in, reacts, seeing her dressed up. She's self-conscious.

                          GERDA
             Well?

Einar can't help smiling at her implied self-criticism.

                         EINAR
             Perfect.    Almost.

He approaches, uses his thumb to gently blend away a smudge
of lipstick from her bottom lip. He nods. Perfect now.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             Good luck...

                                                       26/11/15

EXT. BUSY COPENHAGEN STREET, DAY

Gerda carries her heavy portfolio, optimistic, brisk.


INT. ART DEALER'S OFFICE, DAY

Rasmussen's face - a look of slight distaste. A sea of
Gerda's work, on the desk, the floor - competent but
uninspiring naturalistic depictions of society figures.

                    RASMUSSEN
          All portraits...

Gerda hesitates a beat, the fact being so self-evident.

                    GERDA
          Is that bad?

                    RASMUSSEN
          Not per se, but... this kind of work is not
          really my...

He winces a little.   He has to end this:

                    RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
          Gerda... I don't think it would benefit
          either of us to show these.

A vein begins to throb in Gerda's neck.

                    RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
          It's not a judgement on your abilities - I
          agree with Einar: you could be a first
          class painter if you found the right
          subject matter.

It's the first time Gerda's heard this.     Her eyes shine,
stung, betrayed.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, DAY

Einar works, hears the door. Gerda brings in the portfolio,
sets it down, starts taking off her coat. Einar's tentative:

                    EINAR
          How was it?

                      GERDA
          Fine.

He waits for more, but nothing comes.

                    EINAR
          I finally mixed the right colour for the
          snow.

CONTINUED:

Gerda glances at the canvas, hostile.

                       GERDA
             Another view of Vejle. I don't know how
             you can paint the same thing over and over.

Einar misses a beat.

                       EINAR
             I suppose I just haven't finished with it
             yet.

Gerda heads towards the door.

                          EINAR (cont'd)
             Gerda..?

                       GERDA
             Could you please not speak to Rasmussen
             about me again... My work is my business.
             Stay out of it.

But she disappears into the bedroom, the door slamming
emphatically behind her. Einar's left bewildered.


INT. BEDROOM, DAY

Gerda's already regretting the exchange with Einar. She
unfastens her dress, pulls it off. There's a bloodstain in
her underwear. Damn! She breathes.


INT. STUDIO, DAY

Einar working as Gerda reappears. She's composed now,
refocused, approaches her easel, organises her paints.      Einar
steals a look at her, but says nothing. Works on.
Eventually:

                       GERDA
             I have my period.

                          EINAR (O.S.)
             I'm sorry.

                          GERDA
             Are you?

She turns to find him approaching.

                       EINAR
             Of course I am... You know I am.

A moment of quiet intimacy between them. Gerda shies away,
returns to present concerns... her work...


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                          10.
CONTINUED:

                       GERDA
             Could you help me with something?

Einar's relieved to be able to help.

                         EINAR
             Anything.

                       GERDA
             Ulla has an extra rehearsal. She cancelled
             again. Would you try on her stockings and
             shoes?

Einar's discomfort erupts in a laugh.       Is she serious?

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             I'm just so behind. I don't know how I'll
             be finished in time for her opening...

But he cuts her off:

                       EINAR
             I'll do it. It's fine.

Gerda sets a shoebox and the stocking on the sitter's chair,
goes into the kitchen. Einar moves the box and stockings,
sits in the chair on the dais. The dog leaps up -

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             No... no, not now Hvappe...

He pushes Hvappe down, tests the mesh of the stockings between his
fingers. He rolls up his trousers.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             He almost snagged this...

Gerda marvels at his delicacy. Scolds the dog:

                         GERDA
             Hvappe...

Gerda mixes paints.      Einar battles with the stockings.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             That's backwards...

He fiddles with the second stocking now, a light sweat dewing
his forehead by the time he's rolled both to the knee. He
opens a shoebox: - the yellow pair from the shop window.

                       EINAR
             I saw these in the window of
             Fonnesbech's...

                       GERDA
             Smart aren't they?

CONTINUED:

                       EINAR
             I don't think they'll fit...

                       GERDA
             Well just do what you can.

He takes them out... Something catches in Einar's throat as
he pushes his toes into the shoe. Gerda's eyes are narrow as
she starts work. Einar looks down at his feet, partly
contained in the yellow suede, the disjuncture between the
body above and below the knee... he breathes... can't keep
his hands steady. Then:

                        GERDA (cont'd)
             No.   I need the dress.

They both look over to where Ulla's dress hangs. It is white,
weighted with beads at the hem and cuff. Beautiful.

                       EINAR
             Gerda, I'm not putting it on.

                       GERDA
             I haven't asked you to.

She get sit... lays it across him.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Would you just relax...? The sooner I
             start, the sooner I finish.

Einar yields reluctantly, as Gerda runs her fingers gently
down his face. Satisfied, Gerda returns to work.

Einar's breathing feels slightly laboured now. The dress
weighs heavily. His head moves slightly, feeling it brush at
his neck. His fingers curl involuntarily around the beaded
cuff. The SOUNDSCAPE becomes heightened: the creak of
Gerda's easel, the jangling of her bracelets, the sound of
the harbour, the wind in the ships' riggings. These combine,
fill his head... until:

                       ULLA (O.S.)
             Well hello, there!

Einar starts... Ulla's in the doorway, delighted, with a huge
bunch of lilies. She starts to LAUGH, and because it's Ulla,
Gerda LAUGHS also. The dog YAPS, excited, confused. Einar's
disoriented. Gerda sees this, stops laughing, but...

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             Oh, don't worry my darling...

She hands the flowers to him, kisses him:

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             We're going to call you Lili...

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                          12.
CONTINUED:

Einar manages to laugh now as the dog runs BARKING in
circles, Ulla's delight banishing the day's frustrations.


EXT. HARBOUR, NIGHT

There are lights on in the Widow House.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, NIGHT

Gerda closes the book she's been reading, looks up to see
Einar, working, engrossed. An almost trance-like state. She
watches him a while, then approaches, rests her head against
his back. He's comfortable with this, but works on.

                       GERDA
             Such concentration. Sometimes when you're
             working, I think you're going to slip
             through the surface of the painting and
             vanish.

He smiles a little.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Sink into the bog. Like your friend's kite
             when you were a boy.

                        EINAR
             Hans.   It was Hans' kite I crashed.

Einar enjoys the memory for a moment.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             Poor Hans. He was so proud of it...
             I couldn't believe he even let me
             have a turn...

                       GERDA
             He's probably still sitting on a
             rock, sobbing his heart out.

Einar sets down his brush, turns toward her, away from his
work, smiles.

                       EINAR
             He's a dealer in Paris, peddling
             Old Masters to rich Americans.

                       GERDA
             Oh. So we don't need to worry
             about Hans.

                       EINAR
             No we don't.

He takes her in.

CONTINUED:

                       GERDA
             I didn't mean to disturb you.

                       EINAR
             That's okay. I've finished.

He kisses her.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             And don't worry, I won't disappear into the
             bog.

He widens his eyes, surprised at his own realisation:

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             The bog is in me, silly.

She pushes him off, LAUGHING.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, LATER THAT NIGHT

Einar's in bed. Gerda pulls off her dress, looks round to
see him watching her as she lays her stockings over the chair
beside her dressing table.

                       GERDA
             What?

                       EINAR
             Can't a man watch his wife get undressed?

She goes to take off her lace-edged slip, self-conscious now.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             That slip is new...

                       GERDA
             You're very observant.

                       EINAR
             Leave it on...

She hesitates, but Einar pulls back the sheet... Gerda keeps
the slip on, climbs in beside him. He strokes her body
through the silk...

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             It's very pretty...

                       GERDA
             I might let you borrow it.

Einar shrugs, rising flirtatiously to the challenge.

                       EINAR
             I might enjoy that.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Gerda LAUGHS, and Einar kisses her.      She teases:

                       GERDA
             Oh really...? Is there something you'd like
             to tell me?

                      EINAR
             Why...? Is there something you'd like to
             know...?

His fingers trace, quivering, over her...

                       GERDA
             No... I'm your wife.    I know everything.

Einar thrills, pulls her on top of him, a fresh passion,
fresh risk about their union.


INT. COSTUME SHOP, LATER THAT NIGHT

A champagne cork POPS. Ulla's triumphant first night. She's
on magnificent form, working the room. Gerda's portrait hangs
in pride of place. Gerda and Einar chat with a group that
includes their friends NIELS and ELSA. Ulla swoops in,
WHISPERS something in Gerda's ear. Gerda's eyes register
delight as she looks across at two young men on the other
side of the room.

                       GERDA
             Both of them...?

                       ULLA
             And at the same time!

Einar laughs.    Gerda shakes her head.

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             Married people are so delightfully easy to
             shock.

                       EINAR
             We just pretend to be shocked because it
             encourages you.

                       ULLA
             I know. That's why you're the only
             couple in my party for the Artists
             Ball...

                       EINAR
             Out of the question.

                       ULLA
             Oh, I know Einar hates it, but he'll have
             to bear with us.

                       EINAR
             She can go without me.

                       ULLA
             Gerda without an escort?   It would be a
             scandal.

                       EINAR
             Gerda loves a scandal.

                       GERDA
             You've had too much champagne.

Niels and Elsa hear this, tune in...

                       EINAR
             Look at the way she dresses, flaunting her
             ankles. An invitation to corruption.

                       GERDA
             I don't think anyone is likely to be
             corrupted by seeing my ankles.

                       EINAR
             I was.

The group laughs delighted by Einar's buoyant mood.

                       EINAR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             The first time we met, I was leaving the
             Academy, and she was on the steps,
             flaunting said ankles... And she
             propositioned me!

                       ELSA
             Is that true?!

                       GERDA
             It was a dare. But when I said hello to
             him, he actually blushed! He was so shy! So
             I asked him out.

                       ULLA
             And you said yes -

Einar scrutinises Gerda.

                       EINAR
             She made me. She seemed so sure.

                       GERDA
             I was sure. I still am.

                       NIELS
             Oh please - enough!

Elsa elbows him, turns to Gerda.

                       ELSA
             No - what was it about him?

Gerda looks at Einar.

                       GERDA
             I don't know...

She remembers, drawing Einar into the recollection.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             But we went for coffee, and after, I kissed
             him... and it was the strangest thing... it
             was like kissing myself.

A look between Einar and Gerda, a connection crackling.

                       ULLA
             Well these two won't be staying much
             longer...

                       EINAR
             Unmarried people are so delightfully easy
             to shock.

She and Einar smile, make their way towards the door.


INT. BEDROOM, NIGHT

Einar comes in, Gerda's already in bed.    He starts to
undress, turns out the light.

                       GERDA
             Turn it back on.

He looks at her. She shrugs, smiles - it's her turn, after
all... He turns it back on, a little awkward now, undressing
in front of her. She sees this, toughs it out, watching him
anyway.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Were you really corrupted by my ankles?

Einar wears just his shirt now, begins to unbutton.

                       EINAR
             You were shameless.

                       GERDA
             I still am.

Einar peels off his shirt. Underneath, he wears Gerda's lace-
edged slip. Gerda GASPS slightly... Einar has outdone her
with this imaginative twist. But she rises to the occasion.
Feels the fabric against his body.

She traces her fingers across his chest, challenged, aroused.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, MORNING

Einar asleep, a SCRATCHING sound in the background. We see
quick charcoal strokes on paper, Gerda wrapped in Einar's
dressing gown, at the side of the bed. She's fascinated,
suddenly able to see the femininity of his features, plays
with it, creating a revised Einar... His eyes open...

                       GERDA
             Did I wake you?

He raises his eyebrows, entertained.      What does she think?
She smiles, carries on working.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Sorry... I couldn't sleep.

                       EINAR
             Why?

                       GERDA
             Wondering about things.

                       EINAR
             What things?

                       GERDA
             Wondering if we made a baby last night.

Einar smiles, surprised.

                       EINAR
             What d'you think?

Gerda shrugs, keeps sketching.

                       GERDA
             Wondering when you got so pretty.

                       EINAR
             Oh, I was always pretty, you just never
             noticed.

Gerda LAUGHS, keeps working.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, A WEEK LATER

In the studio, Einar looks at the sketches Gerda has made of
him, darkly fascinated. He hears Gerda come in.

                          GERDA (O.S.)
             Hello...?

                          EINAR
             In here...

Gerda comes in, puts down her workbag, takes off her coat.
Einar's still looking at the sketches. Gerda's a little self-
conscious...

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             These are good.

                       GERDA
             Do you think?

He nods, absolutely serious. Gerda absorbs this, gratified.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Well thank you. Thank you.

Gerda goes out to hang up her coat, calls -

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             I had coffee with Ulla. She asked
             about the Artists' Ball.

Einar draws breath to protest, but:

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Don't worry - I told her no.

                       EINAR
             You should go, you enjoy it.

                       GERDA
             With you I enjoy it.

Einar feels guilty.

                       EINAR
             Look - it's good to be seen at those
             things. I understand that.

                       GERDA
             And that's why you hate them.

Gerda shrugs - she gets it.       He smiles.

                       EINAR
             I feel as though I'm performing myself.

                       GERDA
             Giving them your Einar Wegener.

Exactly.   Gerda looks at him a moment.

CONTINUED:

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Why not give them something different, go
             as someone else?

She tilts her head. A look between them... this is a
departure... Einar hesitates a moment...

                       EINAR
             Did you have someone in particular in mind?

A mischievous smile spreads across Gerda's face... she starts
to laugh, Einar begins to understand... laughs along...

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             No - that's outrageous!

                       GERDA
             You'd be very convincing...    You might even
             enjoy it...

Einar marvels at her... she's only half-joking.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, EVENING

Gerda sweeps a layer of foundation over Einar's face.         When
she's done, he opens his eyes. Gerda's taken aback.

                       GERDA
             You'll have to shave closer.

Einar takes in his blanked-out face in the shaving mirror.
Gerda goes to apply eyeliner...

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Close your eyes... This is hard on someone
             else...

                         EINAR
             Here...

Einar takes the crayon, draws a couple of pretty good lines.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             How's that?

She marvels at his reflection.      It's bizarrely compelling.

                       GERDA
             Better than I ever manage.

His reflection looks back. Gerda's energy is up...       She
drapes her scarf around his neck...

                         GERDA (cont'd)
             Oh, Lili!    I want to sketch you...

CONTINUED:

She hurries him through to the studio... arranges cushions on
the chaise.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Sit!

Einar sits - a distinctive pose.

                       EINAR
             Come on, Hvap!

Hvappe jumps onto his lap. Gerda sketches quickly, absorbed,
excited. She rearranges him, `feminising' his poses.

                       GERDA
             Knee over... head up.. Look at
             those hands... relax...

We see Einar at a series of angles... but his movements are
more and more parodically feminine for Gerda's entertainment.
The more he acts it, the more fun it is, until finally Gerda
scolds, still laughing:

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             No, don't make her a slut!

                       EINAR
             It's your fault, you excite her.

Gerda gets close to pin him still.      His face closes on hers.

                       GERDA
             Why, Miss Lili, you are forward...

                       EINAR
             You have no idea...

He falls on her, laughing, passionate... Gerda responds, but
grabs a cloth and wipes his made-up face as he kisses her.


MONTAGE BEGINS -


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM

We see Gerda's work around the room, now, depicting `Lili's'
progress. Einar, at the mirror, plucks his eyebrows to better
resemble the glamorous arch in Gerda's sketches.


EXT. STREET OUTSIDE WIDOW HOUSE

Einar and Gerda walk, a little way apart. He feels his way
into her gait, she checks back on his progress.




                                                    26/11/15

     EXT. HARBOUR, FISH STALL, DAY

     As Gerda buys fish, Einar is distracted, observing and
     copying the movements of the female customer beside him...


     INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR

     Gerda and Einar arrive.   The stage doorman nods.

                         EINAR
43             Morning, Thorbjorn...                                 43

                         STAGE DOORMAN
               Good morning.


     INT. OPERA HOUSE, COSTUME SHOP, DAY

     Gerda and Einar try on wigs, surreptitious, excited, adjust
     one another's choices. Then, a long line of almost identical
     shoes, beginning in tiny sizes but gradually getting bigger.
     Einar grabs the last - biggest - pair. When he looks up,
     Gerda's showing him a dress...


     INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR, DAY

     Einar and Gerda head out past the stage doorman, very pleased
     with themselves. Gerda is several sizes fatter and taller -
     she wears a wig with a hat on top. Hands stuffed into coat
     pockets hide bulky shoes. Thorbjorn looks up briefly from
     his newspaper. Then as the door closes behind Einar and
     Gerda, he looks up again - ?

     - MONTAGE ENDS -


     INT. WIDOW HOUSE, EVENING

     The Lili sketches depict a gamut of moods, face and posture
     already becoming iconic. Einar in the slip and the new
     shoes, practising his walk to settle his nerves. Hears the
     front door open - quickly calls:

                         EINAR
               I wondered where you were, it's getting
               late.

     Gerda comes in...

                         GERDA
               We have plenty of time.     I bought these...

     Einar takes the stockings with interest. Gerda watches,
     entertained at his enthusiasm, but a little apprehensive..

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Einar, are you sure about tonight?

Einar looks up, surprised. Nods, without hesitation.
Gerda's a little taken aback at his enthusiasm.


EXT. STREET NEAR CANAL, NEAR ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, NIGHT

Dancing light and sound - up ahead, we see a glamorous,
eclectic gathering: the fun-loving, the arrogant, the
eccentric, the bourgeois - all rubbing shoulders on their
way to the Royal Academy.

Two pairs of women's feet in step: Gerda and Einar, approach
the melee. Then Gerda realises Einar has slowed, dropped
back behind her. She turns to see him transformed in a
chiffon dress with a linen sailor's collar and cuffs...

                       GERDA
             What is it...?

Einar's eyes shine animated. He cuts an ungainly figure, but
the impression is more confusing than jarring.

                       EINAR
             Am I pretty enough?

Gerda's surprised by the sincerity of the question.

                       GERDA
             Of course you are...

He takes Gerda's hand and she pulls closer.

                       EINAR
             I'll never be as pretty as you.

Gerda studies the features, the fire behind the eyes. An
intensity she had not been expecting... something new... A
charged moment... Gerda's genuinely moved... but then
Einar/Lili laughs, breaks away... leaving Gerda with a beat
of emotion that doesn't belong anywhere.


INT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, STAIRCASE, NIGHT

Gerda and `Lili' mingle with the crowd.    A VOICE rings out:

                       ULLA
             My darling!

A flicker of fear in Lili... until Gerda interposes herself:

                       GERDA
             Ulla, let me introduce...


                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Ulla's eyes snag for a moment as they search the familiar
face and realisation dawns. Delight floods her face. Then:

                       ULLA
             It's Lili...!

                       GERDA
             That's right. Einar's cousin from
             Vejle...

                       ULLA
             My dear, you're exquisite...

She LAUGHS, thrilled, exchanges a look with Gerda. Lili's
eyelashes flutter, a picture of shyness as Ulla summons the
rest of her party - revelling in their shared secret...

                       ULLA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             In - let's go in...

Gerda and Lili - holding hands - join the crush:

                       EINAR/LILI
             You won't leave me, will you...?

Gerda looks down at Einar/Lili's grip on her hand.

                       GERDA
                 (sincerely)
             No. No, never.

She squeezes the hand and they press forward together.


INT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, GREAT HALL, NIGHT

A spectacular event. An orchestra plays and people dance.
Ulla's party drink and laugh. Gerda and Lili hang back a
little, observing. There's a circle of men in tuxedos nearby.
One glances across at Lili. Lili looks away, blushing.

                       EINAR/LILI
             People are looking.

                       GERDA
             Well you're a pretty girl, you'll
             have to get used to that.

But she sees Lili's really uncomfortable.

                       GERDA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             It's fine. You're just feeling
             self-conscious.

                         ELSA (O.S.)
             Gerda - !

They spot Elsa across the crowd... Lili shrinks.

                       EINAR/LILI
             Go and talk to her...

                       GERDA
             No, I'll stay with you...

                       EINAR/LILI
             Go. I'll be fine. Go before she
             comes over here...

Gerda reluctantly crosses the room and greets Elsa warmly.
But by the time she glances back, Lili has gone.

Lili sits at the edge of the dancefloor on a bench carved
with mermaids, a nerve fluttering in her cheek. We see a
young man, HENRIK SANDAHL, study her closely - closely enough
to see she is not everything she appears, but this only seems
to intrigue him. He sits beside her. Lili self-consciously
takes a notebook from her bag, begins to jot things down.
Henrik leans in, his raven hair in Lili's peripheral vision,
leans forward until Lili's refusal to engage becomes comical.

                       HENRIK
             Are you a reporter?

Lili looks up.

                         EINAR/LILI
                   (flatly)
             No.

                       HENRIK
             A poetess...?

Lili packs up the notebook and hurries away... Finds a
corridor, leading off the hall - quieter, darker...

Lili feels her way along the wall, relieved to be in the
cooler air, away from the party. As her eyes adjust to the
darkness, she sees a couple kissing in an alcove. A flash of
the woman's white thigh, as the man pushes up her dress.
Lili turns away, discomfited, walks straight back into
Henrik.

                       HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             Do you know the story of this oak
             tree?

                         EINAR/LILI
             Mm...?

Henrik indicates a tree outside, behind Lili...

                       HENRIK
             They say if you eat its acorns you
             can make a wish and become anyone
             you want for a day.

Einar's reaction flashes through Lili's facade.

                       EINAR/LILI
             Why would they say that...?

Henrik bows, entertained by the effect he's had...

                       HENRIK
             Henrik Sandahl. At your disposal.

A moment's hesitation, then:

                        EINAR/LILI
             Lili...

                       HENRIK
             Are you here with someone, Lili?

                       EINAR/LILI
             Yes - my cousin's wife.

                       HENRIK
             Who's your cousin?

Lili hesitates, turns back:

                       EINAR/LILI
             Einar Wegener. He's a painter.

                       HENRIK
             Rather a good one.   Better than
             most people think.

                       EINAR/LILI
             Is that right?

                       HENRIK
             Most people our age at any rate.

                        EINAR/LILI
             Well....

She makes to leave again, but:

                       HENRIK
             Don't go back in. It's cooler
             here. Besides, I'm a romantic.

                       EINAR/LILI
             Oh really...

                       HENRIK
             I prefer the shadows and...

Lili steals a look at him.     He lowers his voice... sincere...

CONTINUED:

                       HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             I don't mean to presume, but I've
             been watching you.

A tremor of panic runs through Lili...

                       HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             I think you might be the same.

Henrik holds out his hand. Lili looks at it, a sense of
connection she can't understand, previously unimaginable...
Then, trembling, Lili reaches out and rests her delicate,
manicured hand in Henrik's... and suddenly her nerves are
completely steady. Henrik leads Lili along the corridor,
away from the hall...


INT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, GREAT HALL, NIGHT

Noisier and smokier now, too much aquavit drunk, the guests a
little out of focus. Gerda scans the dishevelled crowds,
concerned - no sign of Lili. Suddenly, Ulla's at her side.

                       GERDA
             Have you seen Einar? I can't find
             him.

                       ULLA
             Of course you can't, he isn't here!

Ulla and Gerda laugh... Ulla raises her glass... more fun!
But Gerda excuses herself, and continues looking...


EXT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, LIFE-DRAWING ROOM, NIGHT

Lili and Henrik sit on a bench in the lee of a sculpted
classical nude. Lili's cheeks burn. Henrik is clearly
fascinated. The slight sense of playacting between them only
heightens their excitement.

                       HENRIK
             You're different from other girls.

Lili scoffs gently.

                       EINAR/LILI
             That's not a very original line.

                          HENRIK
             It's true.     You're old fashioned.

Lili takes Henrik in, decides to continue...

                       EINAR/LILI
             Provincial. I'm new to the city.

CONTINUED:

                       HENRIK
             No, it's more than that. I feel
             I'd need to ask permission before I
             kissed you.

A bolt of something goes through Lili. Her eyes sink, drawn
and repulsed, to Henrik's lips. She can hardly breathe...

                       EINAR/LILI
             I probably ought to find Gerda.

She heads back toward the corridor... Henrik grabs her hand.

                       HENRIK
             Why don't you tell her I'll walk
             you home...?

                       EINAR/LILI
             She wouldn't like that...

He advances, his body pressing against her, commanding,
holding her fixed in the doorway...

                       HENRIK
             Lili...

Lili pulls away, flustered, aroused...

                       EINAR/LILI
             Einar might be waiting up... he
             wouldn't like this...

                       HENRIK
             Wouldn't he...?

                       EINAR/LILI
             No...

                       HENRIK
             Lili...

He steadies her... repeating her name...

                       HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             Lili... Lili.

Three times a charm... We see something shift in Lili...
Henrik senses it... He kisses her. When he releases her she
gasps, and he kisses her again, finds his passion returned
this time... When she finally catches her breath she can't
look at him...

                       EINAR/LILI
             You didn't ask permission...

                       HENRIK
             I couldn't risk you saying no.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Standing in the corridor, by the oak, Gerda watches, stunned,
as Lili clutches Henrik's arm, looks suddenly faint, upset...
Lili looks down, confused and then panicked. Blood pours
from her nose, down the front of her dress... she's appalled.

                       HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             What's happened..? Let me...

Henrik tries to find a handkerchief... Then sees Gerda
approaching... He pulls away from Lili...

                       HENRIK (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             I'm sorry I don't know what...

Lili holds out her arms to Gerda. Henrik steps back... Gerda
reaches Lili, quickly takes her weight... Gerda wraps her
scarf around `Lili', who now looks like Einar in grotesque
drag, smeared with make-up and blood.

                       GERDA
             Quickly, lean on me...

Henrik watches, and onlookers stare as Gerda supports Einar
out of the ball... They stumble, clinging together, ashamed.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, NEXT MORNING

Einar paints.    In a smart male suit.   He is stiffly composed.

Gerda comes into the studio, in her nightclothes. Finds
Einar deeply immersed. No trace of the night's upset.

                       GERDA
             How are you...?

                       EINAR
             You were late home last night, I
             thought I'd let you sleep. How was
             it? Did Lili have fun?

Gerda's stunned.     Goes to the kitchen, upset.

In the kitchen, Lili's bloodied clothes are soaking in a
bucket. Gerda struggles with the sight. Begins to make
coffee, then...

Gerda returns to the studio, watches Einar, anger building.
He allows it a while, then turns, braced to face her:

                       GERDA
             I think it would be better if Lili
             didn't come here again.

                        EINAR
             Fine.   I understand.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           29.
CONTINUED:

                       GERDA
             You know what I would like to
             understand?

Einar takes Gerda in... how furious, how shaken she looks.

                       GERDA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             Exactly what happened between you
             and Sandahl last night?

                       EINAR
                 (quickly)
             Nothing.

Gerda HUFFS, disbelieving.        Einar repeats himself, angrily:

                       EINAR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             It was nothing.

                       GERDA
             Did he know it was you?

Einar blushes, shies away.

                       EINAR
             It wasn't as simple as that.     It's
             hard to explain...

Gerda loses control, shouts at him:

                       GERDA
             I watched him kiss you, Einar, so
             could you please make an effort?!

Einar's shocked, ashamed.        He takes stock, then quietly:

                       EINAR
             He may have known who I was. But I
             wasn't always... me. There was a
             moment when I was... just Lili.
             And I think he could see that. Do
             you see?

Gerda struggles to comprehend this shift in the landscape.

                       GERDA
             But Lili doesn't exist.     We made
             her up.

                         EINAR
             I know...

                       GERDA
             We were playing a game!

                        EINAR
             I know we were... but then it
             changed...
                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                       30.
CONTINUED:

Gerda's mind reels, panic rises...

                       GERDA
             This is absurd. We need to stop.
             Make it stop Einar.

With genuine anxiety:

                       EINAR
             I'm going to try...

She goes, still distressed, leaving Einar alone.


EXT. WIDOW HOUSE, EARLY MORNING, TWO WEEKS LATER

The Chinese Laundress RINGS her tiny BELLS along the street.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, MORNING

The Lili portraits are gone. Einar regards a canvas. Failing
to paint. In the kitchen, Gerda chops vegetables, throws
them in a pan. She hovers in the doorway to the studio.

                       GERDA
             Another headache?

                       EINAR
             It's nothing...

She goes back into the kitchen again...

                       GERDA
             Can I get you something?

                         EINAR
             I'm fine.

Gerda returns to chopping.

                       GERDA
             Maybe you should see a doctor.

Einar grows agitated.

                       EINAR
             Gerda... I'm fine.

Gerda looks round to see Einar now in his coat. He quickly
collects a small suitcase, goes out, leaving Gerda to fret.


EXT. OPERA HOUSE, DAY

No lights on, no signs of life.



                                                   26/11/15

INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR, DAY

Einar passes through, nods amiably to the familiar doorman.


INT. COSTUME SHOP, DAY

Einar turns on the lights, quickly pulls off his coat.    He
leans forward, bracing against the bench, looks in the
mirror. There's a desperation about him. But now he sees:
the front of his shirt gapes - reveals a cleavage, formed by
his rounded shoulders. Einar is compelled... nervously
unbuttons his shirt to the waist and leans forward again.
The effect is startling. He traces the shape of his
`breasts' with trembling hands.

With a new urgency, he quickly strips off shirt, trousers,
terrified that someone might catch him, yet driven to press
on. He pulls off his underwear, returns to the mirror, pushes
his cock back between his legs, squeezing his thighs tight
until he has an approximation of a vagina. He rounds his
shoulders, takes in the arresting transformation, breathless
with excitement, terror. A sense of impending inevitable
transgression.

He opens his case. A carefully folded silk package unfurls
into a dress, brushes against his skin.


INT. STUDIO, DAY

Gerda sits in the chair looking out of the window, face set
against terror, her sketchbook closed in her lap, brooding,
pressure building. She opens the sketchbook: Lili...


INT CAFE ON CANAL, DAY

Einar/Lili arrives inside a cafe, pushes back a headscarf. We
see Henrik waiting at a table. He quickly stands when he
spots Lili - who is consumed with shyness, real fear.

                    HENRIK
          I didn't think you'd come.

Lili settles in her seat.

                     EINAR/LILI
          No.   Nor did I.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, LATER

Gerda begins to sketch, almost afraid to begin. But her
energy gathers and there is soon anger and desire in the work
as she conjures a Lili with dark erotic potential, a frenzied
relationship with the subject developing...


                                                26/11/15
                                                     32.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, EVENING

Gerda lies on the chaise, exhausted. Hears the door, doesn't
move. Einar appears, in his overcoat. After a moment:

                    GERDA
          I thought you might not come back.

                    EINAR
          That's absurd...

                    GERDA
          Is it?

Einar can hardly bear the question... feels terrible, wraps
his arms around her. Then sees, at an angle, in the half-
light, the new Lili picture. A nude with female hips and
breasts. A slash of red mouth. A cigarette.


INT. ART DEALER'S OFFICE, A MONTH LATER, DAY

A door opens and Gerda sits up - a THIN YOUNG MAN appears.

                    THIN YOUNG MAN
          He won't be much longer.

Gerda sits back, too pessimistic to feel nervous.


INT. ART DEALER'S OFFICE, HALF AN HOUR LATER

Rasmussen studies a series of Gerda's portraits, his mouth
puckered with poorly disguised distaste. Gerda steels
herself to withstand the humiliation.

                    RASMUSSEN
          I just... I don't know...

And then he sees the Lili nude. He's suddenly intrigued...

                    RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
          The model...?

                    GERDA
          Einar's cousin.

                    RASMUSSEN
          Yes, the resemblance is...

Rasmussen's mind races.

                    RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
          Are there others...?

                    GERDA
          A series back at the studio.

CONTINUED:

Rasmussen licks his lips, excited but uncertain...

                       RASMUSSEN
             These are different... For these, I don't
             know... there may be a market.

Gerda has to confirm what she's heard:

                       GERDA
             You're taking them.

                       RASMUSSEN
             Well, yes...

He's surprised as she is.


EXT. HENRIK'S HOUSE, DAY

Lili hurries past the endless orange facades of a long row of
terraced houses, Gerda's embroidered wrap flying in the wind
behind her. Knocks at a door, breathless...


INT. HENRIK'S HOUSE, DAY

Henrik welcomes Lili at the open door...

                          HENRIK
             Come in...

He closes the door against the world. Lili takes in the
space. She's delighted by it -

                        LILI
             I don't have long... Gerda's seeing
             Rasmussen.

Henrik gestures for Lili to sit.      She settles on the couch.

                       HENRIK
             I don't like all these lies.

                       LILI
             She's very protective.

                       HENRIK
             Why don't you just tell her about
             us?

                       LILI
             I couldn't do that...

Lili seems a little panicked...

                       HENRIK
             Sorry - I don't want to upset you.

He sits beside her, settles her...

                       HENRIK (cont'd)
             Come here...

Lili lets herself be drawn closer to him... He strokes her
face. Lili smiles, adoring. Henrik kisses her and she
responds eagerly. His hand works its way down her body,
between her legs. Lili squirms, uncomfortable. He
persists... Lili bears it as long as she can, then gently:

                       LILI
             No... Henrik...

                        HENRIK
             Yes...

                        LILI
             No...

Still in the moment of passion...

                        HENRIK
             Einar...

Lili recoils, stunned... astonished...

                        LILI
             What...?

                       HENRIK
                 (sweetly)
             Come on... it's alright...

But Lili pushes him away, upset, bewildered...

                       LILI
             I'm sorry, I don't understand...

Henrik's frustrated.

                       HENRIK
             Einar... please...

Lili panics, grabs her things to leave, horribly exposed...

                       LILI
             I don't know what you mean... I don't know
             what you want...

                       HENRIK
             I want you!

                        LILI
             No...



                                                     (CONTINUED)
                                                   26/11/15
                                                             35.
CONTINUED:

                      HENRIK
             Yes... wait... Wait!      Lili... Lili, come
             back...

But Lili bolts, away and out through the front door, leaving
Henrik powerless, bereft.


EXT. HENRIK'S HOUSE, DAY

Lili rushes away, disorientated, along the row of garish
facades, their orange now seeming grotesque...


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, DAY

Gerda struggles in with her portfolio. Heads for the kitchen,
preoccupied by her experience with Rasmussen, is taken aback
to see Lili at the table, Gerda's embroidered wrap pulled
tight about her. Then Lili looks round - her face swollen and
streaked with tears.

                       GERDA
                 (concerned)
             Are you alright...?

Lili reaches out her hand and Gerda takes it...

                         EINAR/LILI
             No...

She holds Gerda at arms length.       Takes a deep breath.

                       EINAR/LILI (cont'd)
             I've been seeing Henrik Sandahl.

Gerda reels, speechless as Lili clatters out, stumbling to
the bedroom. Closes the bedroom door.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, KITCHEN, 20 MINUTES LATER

Gerda sits - waiting. Finally, Einar comes back, in male
clothing. Looks devastated.

                       EINAR
             I thought perhaps you knew.

                         GERDA
                   (barely audible)
             No.

                       EINAR
             You always seemed to know everything.

                         GERDA
             Not this.
